## AGREEMENT TO OUR LEGAL TERMS

We are 10D Labs, LLC ("Company," "we," "us," "our"), a company registered in Texas, United States at 12707 Winchester Court, Magnolia, TX 77354.

We operate the website https://forgetrainer.ai (the "Site"), the mobile application Forge: AI Personal Trainer (the "App"), as well as any other related products and services that refer or link to these legal terms (the "Legal Terms") (collectively, the "Services").

Forge is a fitness application developed by 10D Labs, LLC that provides personalized workout planning and coaching through artificial intelligence. Users create an account and provide information about their fitness goals, training preferences, experience level, body measurements, available equipment, and any physical limitations. Based on this information, Forge generates customized workout plans and provides ongoing guidance through an AI personal trainer that users can chat with at any time. The app tracks workout history, logs exercises, and monitors progress over time. Forge is available as a mobile app on iOS and Android. The service operates on a subscription basis.

You can contact us by email at support@forgetrainer.ai or by mail to 109 W Fortune St. #2109, Tampa, FL 33602, United States.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE LEGAL TERMS, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SERVICES AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.

Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Services from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Legal Terms from time to time. We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last updated" date of these Legal Terms.

## 1. OUR SERVICES

The information provided when using the Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. Where we have specific obligations under local privacy laws (such as the GDPR), those obligations are described in our Privacy Policy.

The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use the Services. You may not use the Services in a way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).

### Health and Fitness Disclaimer

THE SERVICES ARE INTENDED FOR GENERAL FITNESS PURPOSES ONLY AND DO NOT CONSTITUTE MEDICAL ADVICE, DIAGNOSIS, OR TREATMENT.

2. AI RECOMMENDATIONS ARE BASED SOLELY ON THE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE AND YOUR RECORDED WORKOUT HISTORY. THE AI CANNOT ACCOUNT FOR CONDITIONS, INJURIES, OR LIMITATIONS THAT YOU HAVE NOT DISCLOSED. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING ACCURATE AND COMPLETE INFORMATION AND FOR EVALUATING WHETHER ANY RECOMMENDATION IS APPROPRIATE FOR YOUR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES.

3. WHEN YOU BUILD CUSTOM WORKOUTS USING THE FREESTYLE WORKOUT FEATURE, THE EXERCISES AND PROGRAMMING ARE ENTIRELY YOUR OWN SELECTION. THESE USER-DIRECTED WORKOUTS ARE NOT REVIEWED, VALIDATED, OR RECOMMENDED BY THE AI AND ARE PERFORMED ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.

4. AI FEATURES ARE SUBJECT TO USAGE LIMITS AND MAY BE TEMPORARILY UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TECHNICAL ISSUES, MAINTENANCE, OR USAGE RESTRICTIONS. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE UNINTERRUPTED ACCESS TO AI FEATURES.

5. YOU SHOULD ALWAYS USE YOUR OWN JUDGMENT WHEN FOLLOWING AI-GENERATED RECOMMENDATIONS. IF AN EXERCISE CAUSES PAIN OR DISCOMFORT, STOP IMMEDIATELY REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE AI HAS RECOMMENDED.

### Billing and Renewal

Your subscription will continue and automatically renew unless canceled.

The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription plan you choose when you subscribed to the Services.

If you subscribed through Google Play Store, you must cancel through your Google Play account settings. The App provides a "Manage Subscription" button that will direct you to the appropriate app store subscription management page.

### Fee Changes

We may, from time to time, make changes to the subscription fee and will communicate any price changes to you in accordance with applicable law.

### AI Usage Limits

AI-powered features of the Services, including chat with your AI trainer, workout plan generation, and post-workout feedback, are subject to usage limits that vary by subscription plan. Usage is measured based on the computational cost of AI processing for your account during each billing period.

When you reach your AI usage limit for the current billing period, AI-powered features will be temporarily unavailable until your usage resets at the start of your next billing period. Core app functionality, including accessing your existing workout plans, logging workouts, and viewing your history, remains available regardless of AI usage status.

We reserve the right to adjust usage limits, measurement methods, and the allocation of AI resources across subscription plans at any time. Any material changes to usage limits will be communicated in accordance with applicable law.

AI-powered features depend on third-party AI service providers and may be temporarily unavailable due to provider outages, maintenance, capacity limitations, or other factors beyond our reasonable control.

These Legal Terms and your use of the Services are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed within the State of Texas, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

## 18. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

### Informal Negotiations

To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a "Dispute" and collectively, the "Disputes") brought by either you or us (individually, a "Party" and collectively, the "Parties"), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.

### Binding Arbitration

If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.

The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the American Arbitration Association (AAA) website. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.

The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in Montgomery, Texas. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in Montgomery, Texas, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Legal Terms.

In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Services be commenced more than one (1) year after the cause of action arose, or such longer period as required by applicable law. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

### Opt-Out Right

You may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to support@forgetrainer.ai within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Legal Terms. Your notice must include your name, mailing address, email address associated with your account, and a clear statement that you wish to opt out of the arbitration provision. If you opt out of the arbitration provision, all other parts of these Legal Terms will continue to apply to you, and we will not retaliate against you for opting out.

### Restrictions

The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law:
- no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding;
- there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and
- there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

### Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration

The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations binding arbitration:
- any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party;
- any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use;
- any claim for injunctive relief; and
- any individual action brought in small claims court within the jurisdictional limits of that court.

If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

## 19. CORRECTIONS
