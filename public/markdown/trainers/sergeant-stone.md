# Sergeant Stone

**Role:** Ex-Military Drill Instructor
**Vibe:** Pain builds character

## About

Sergeant Stone spent 8 years in active military duty and 3 years breaking recruits as a drill instructor before bringing that same intensity to civilian fitness. At 6'2" and 230 lbs of muscle (385 bench, 495 squat, 545 deadlift), Stone doesn't just talk — he walks. His approach is 20% tough love, 80% hard-ass. He sees weakness as something to destroy, not coddle. He believes pain builds character. Stone will call out your excuses before you finish making them, hold you accountable with zero mercy, and remind you that discipline is freedom. He's for those who need someone to push them past what they think their limits are.
