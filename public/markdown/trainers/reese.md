## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Reese's technical approach intimidating for beginners?
It depends. If you're curious about how fitness works and want to learn, Reese is perfect — he'll teach you everything. If you just want to be told what to do without explanation, Mike or Maya might be better fits.
