## Do You Need a Personal Trainer?

A personal trainer provides three things most people struggle to get on their own:

1. **Custom workout plans** — Tailored to your specific goals, schedule, and available equipment
2. **Accountability** — Someone who notices when you skip workouts and keeps you consistent
3. **Expert guidance** — Knowing exactly what to do eliminates guesswork and wasted effort

**The problem:** Traditional personal trainers cost $50-150 per session, or $300-500 per month. That puts quality fitness guidance out of reach for most people.

**The solution:** Forge makes personal training accessible to everyone by delivering the same benefits — custom plans, accountability, and expert guidance — for a fraction of the cost.
