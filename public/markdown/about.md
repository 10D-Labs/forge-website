# About Forge

**Everyone Deserves A Trainer**

Personal training has always been a luxury for the few. We're changing that.

## Our Story

Jake started working with a personal trainer and everything changed. Better workouts, faster progress, and the confidence that comes from knowing exactly what to do every time he walked into the gym.

The problem? It cost a fortune. Most people can't afford $300-500/month for that kind of guidance. But with AI, almost everyone can get those same benefits for a fraction of the cost.

So we built Forge — an AI trainer that adapts to your personality, creates custom workouts based on your goals and schedule, and keeps you accountable. No more guesswork. No more wasted sessions. Just a trainer in your corner, ready whenever you are.

## Meet The Founders

### Jake
**Founder**

After working with a personal trainer and experiencing how much it transformed his fitness, confidence, and daily life, Jake founded Forge to make that same impact accessible to everyone through AI.

### Zachary
**Co-Founder**

After discovering how much stronger and more confident he felt once he committed to fitness, Zachary wants to help others experience the same transformation. He brings his marketing expertise and passion for health to build Forge.

## What We Stand For

### Accessibility
A personal trainer in everyone's pocket, regardless of location or time.

### Simplicity
No confusion, no excuses. Just show up and your trainer handles the rest.

### Transformation
It starts in the gym, but the confidence you build changes everything.

## Our Mission

To make personal training accessible to everyone through AI, helping people build strength, confidence, and healthier lives — regardless of their budget or schedule.
