## How to perform

1. Adjust the glute ham raise machine to fit your body.
2. Position yourself face down on the machine with your ankles secured.
3. Place your hands on your chest or cross them over your chest.
4. Engage your hamstrings and glutes to lift your upper body up towards the ceiling.
5. Continue lifting until your body is in a straight line from your head to your heels.
6. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your body back down to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lower yourself under control by eccentric hamstring contraction; do not just fall forward.
- Push your toes into the foot plate as you lift your body back up to engage both the hamstrings and glutes.
- Keep your hips extended throughout the movement; do not bend at the waist.

## Common mistakes

- Bending at the hips to initiate the upward movement, which turns it into a Back Extension instead of a hamstring exercise.
- Dropping too fast on the eccentric (lowering) phase, which wastes the most valuable part of the exercise.
- Not using the full range of motion by stopping short of a fully extended position at the bottom.
