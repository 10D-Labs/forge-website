## How to perform

1. Start in a high plank position with your hands directly under your shoulders and your body in a straight line.
2. Engage your core and lift your right foot off the ground, bringing your right knee towards your left elbow.
3. Return your right foot to the starting position and repeat the movement with your left foot towards your right elbow.
4. Continue alternating sides, moving at a controlled pace.
5. Keep your hips level and avoid lifting your hips too high or sagging them too low.
6. Maintain a steady breathing pattern throughout the exercise.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Drive the knee across to the opposite elbow with intent, aiming to make contact or get as close as possible.
- Keep your hips level and resist the urge to rotate or hike one hip higher than the other.
- Brace your core as if someone is about to push you off balance before each knee drive.

## Common mistakes

- Lifting the hips too high into a pike position, which reduces the plank demand and the ab activation.
- Moving too fast and sacrificing the cross-body reach, turning it into a standard Mountain Climber instead of a targeted oblique exercise.
- Letting the shoulders drift forward over the hands, which overloads the wrists and reduces core engagement.
