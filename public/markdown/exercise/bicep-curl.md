## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height and position yourself on the machine with your back against the pad.
2. Grasp the handles with an underhand grip, palms facing up, and keep your elbows close to your sides.
3. Exhale and curl the handles upward, contracting your biceps.
4. Pause for a moment at the top of the movement, squeezing your biceps.
5. Inhale and slowly lower the handles back to the starting position, fully extending your arms.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Adjust the seat so your elbows align with the machine's pivot point for proper leverage and full range of motion.
- Squeeze hard at the top of the curl and resist the weight on the way down for 2-3 seconds.
- Avoid lifting your elbows off the pad at the top of the movement to maintain strict biceps isolation.

## Common mistakes

- Setting the seat too high or too low, which misaligns the elbows with the pivot and causes shoulder strain.
- Using momentum to swing the weight up instead of curling with control.
- Not going through a full range of motion by stopping short of full extension at the bottom.

## FAQ

### Is the machine Bicep Curl as effective as free weight curls?

Machine curls provide constant tension through the entire range of motion, which free weights don't (free weights are hardest in the middle). Both are effective, and machines are great for isolating the biceps without stabilization demands.

### Should I do machine curls before or after free weight curls?

Do free weight curls first when you're fresh (they require more stabilization), then finish with machine curls to safely push to failure without worrying about form breakdown.

### What muscles does the Bicep Curl work?

The Bicep Curl primarily targets the biceps, with secondary activation in the forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.

### Is the Bicep Curl good for beginners?

Yes, the Bicep Curl is rated as a beginner-level exercise. It's a great starting point for building biceps strength.
