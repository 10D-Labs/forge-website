## How to perform

2. Extend your legs behind you, resting on your toes, and lift your body into a plank position.
3. Keeping your core engaged and your hips stable, lift one hand off the ground and tap the opposite shoulder.
4. Return the hand to the ground and repeat with the other hand.
5. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Widen your knees slightly to create a more stable base and reduce hip rocking during each tap.
- Squeeze your glutes hard before lifting each hand to lock your hips in place.
- Tap the opposite shoulder with a controlled two-second touch rather than rushing through reps.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the hips rotate side to side with each tap instead of keeping them square to the floor.
- Shifting all your weight onto the supporting arm instead of distributing it across your core.
- Placing hands too close together, which makes the base unstable and forces compensatory movement.
