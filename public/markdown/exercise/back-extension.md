2. Sit on the machine with your back against the pad and your feet secured.
3. Place your hands on the handles or grip bars.
4. Engage your core and slowly lean forward, allowing your back to round slightly.
5. Pause for a moment at the bottom position, feeling a stretch in your lower back.
6. Using your back muscles, slowly raise your torso back to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Adjust the machine so the pivot point aligns with your hip crease, allowing your torso to hinge freely.
- Move through the range of motion slowly and deliberately, pausing at the top when your body forms a straight line.
- Hold a weight plate against your chest for added resistance once bodyweight becomes comfortable for 15+ reps.

## Common mistakes

- Hyperextending past neutral (going too far back), which compresses the lumbar spine.
- Rounding the back on the way down instead of hinging at the hips with a neutral spine.
- Using momentum to swing up quickly, which defeats the purpose of strengthening the spinal erectors.
