## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat of the machine so that your shoulders are aligned with The pad.
2. Place your toes on the lower portion of the platform and position your knees under The pad.
3. Grasp the handles on the sides of the seat for stability.
4. Press The pad down by extending your ankles, lifting your heels as high as possible.
5. Pause for a moment at the top of the movement, then slowly lower your heels back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Position your toes on the lower edge of the platform so your heels can drop fully for a complete stretch.
- Press through the big toe side of your foot to emphasize the medial gastrocnemius and soleus.
- Pause at the top of each rep for 1-2 seconds with a hard squeeze to maximize the contraction.

## Common mistakes

- Bouncing at the bottom of the movement, which uses the Achilles tendon elasticity instead of muscular contraction.
- Using too short a range of motion, which limits both the stretch and contraction phases of the exercise.
- Placing the knees too far under the pad, which changes the ankle angle and reduces calf activation.
