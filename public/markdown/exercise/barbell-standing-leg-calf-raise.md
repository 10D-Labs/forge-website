## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and place a barbell across your upper back.
2. Raise your heels off the ground as high as possible, using your calves.
3. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your heels back down to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Rise up onto the balls of your feet as high as possible, holding the top position for 1-2 seconds for peak contraction.
- Use a raised surface under the balls of your feet so your heels can drop below the platform for a full stretch.
- Perform reps slowly (2 seconds up, 2-second hold, 3 seconds down) for maximum calf activation.

## Common mistakes

- Bouncing at the bottom and using the Achilles tendon stretch reflex instead of muscular effort.
- Not rising high enough onto the toes, performing partial reps that limit calf development.
- Bending the knees during the calf raise, which shifts work from the calves to the quads.
