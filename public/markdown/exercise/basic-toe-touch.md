## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your arms by your sides.
2. Bend forward at the waist, keeping your back straight and your knees slightly bent.
3. Reach down towards your toes with your hands, keeping your legs as straight as possible.
4. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then slowly return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Bend from the hips, not the waist, to protect the lower back and target the hamstrings effectively.
- Keep a slight bend in the knees if your hamstrings are tight; this protects the lower back.
- Reach toward your toes and hold the bottom position for 15-30 seconds to develop flexibility.

## Common mistakes

- Rounding the upper back aggressively to reach the toes, which strains the spine instead of stretching the hamstrings.
- Bouncing at the bottom to reach further, which can cause muscle strains and does not improve flexibility.
- Locking the knees fully straight, which can hyperextend the knee joint and compress the sciatic nerve.
