## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a barbell in front of you with an overhand grip.
2. Keep your arms straight and your back straight throughout the exercise.
3. Lift your shoulders up towards your ears as high as possible, squeezing your traps at the top.
4. Hold for a moment, then slowly lower your shoulders back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Shrug your shoulders straight up toward your ears as high as possible, then hold the peak contraction for 1-2 seconds.
- Keep your arms completely straight throughout; don't bend the elbows to assist the shrug.
- Use straps if your grip fails before your traps are fully fatigued, since heavy shrugs demand significant grip endurance.

## Common mistakes

- Rolling the shoulders forward or backward during the shrug, which doesn't add benefit and risks shoulder injury.
- Using too much weight with a tiny range of motion instead of shrugging through a full up-and-down range.
- Bending the elbows and turning it into an upright row hybrid.

## FAQ

### Should I roll my shoulders during shrugs?

No. Shoulder rolling adds no extra trap activation and puts the shoulder joint in a compromised position under load. Shrug straight up and straight down.

### How heavy should I shrug?

Heavy. The traps are strong muscles that respond to heavy loads. Use weight that allows at least 8-10 reps with a full shrug to your ears. If you can't get your shoulders to your ears, the weight is too heavy.

### Do I need to train shrugs if I do Deadlifts?

Deadlifts do work the traps isometrically, but they don't move the traps through their full range of motion. If you want maximum trap development, add direct shrug work.

### What muscles does the Barbell Shrug work?

The Barbell Shrug primarily targets the traps, with secondary activation in the shoulders. It's classified as a strength exercise for the back.

### Is the Barbell Shrug good for beginners?

Yes, the Barbell Shrug is rated as a beginner-level exercise. It's a great starting point for building traps strength.
