2. Grasp the barbell with an overhand grip, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3. Keep your back straight and your core engaged.
4. Pull the barbell up towards your chin, leading with your elbows.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the barbell back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use a grip slightly wider than shoulder width to reduce impingement risk on the shoulder joint.
- Pull the bar up to mid-chest level (not chin level) while leading with the elbows.
- Keep the bar close to your body throughout the entire pull.

## Common mistakes

- Using too narrow a grip, which internally rotates the shoulder and increases impingement risk.
- Pulling the bar too high (above the collarbone), which forces the shoulder into a compromised position.
- Swinging the body to generate momentum instead of pulling with strict form.
