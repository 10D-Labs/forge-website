## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height and position yourself on the machine with your back against the backrest.
2. Place your feet on the footrests and grasp the handles for stability.
3. Engage your adductor muscles and slowly bring your legs together, squeezing your inner thighs.
4. Pause for a moment at the peak contraction, then slowly return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Squeeze your inner thighs together and hold the closed position for 1-2 seconds for maximum contraction.
- Control the eccentric phase as you let the legs open back up; don't let the weight stack slam.
- Keep your back flat against the pad and avoid rounding your spine during the movement.

## Common mistakes

- Rushing through reps and using the weight stack's momentum rather than muscular control.
- Gripping the handles too tightly and tensing the upper body, which reduces focus on the adductors.
- Setting the starting position too wide, which can strain the groin, especially if you lack flexibility.
