2. Extend your arm straight up, keeping your elbow slightly bent.
3. Lower the dumbbell down towards your shoulder, keeping your elbow close to your body.
4. Press the dumbbell back up to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch arms.

## Pro tips

- Grip the dumbbell with a neutral (hammer) grip, palm facing inward throughout the entire press.
- Brace your core and press your back firmly into the decline bench to prevent rotation from the single-arm load.
- Lower the dumbbell slowly toward your shoulder, keeping the elbow tucked close to your side for maximum tricep emphasis.

## Common mistakes

- Allowing the torso to rotate toward the pressing arm, which reduces tricep load and creates a stability risk on the decline.
- Flaring the elbow out wide, which shifts the exercise from a tricep-focused press to a Chest Press.
- Using too heavy a weight on the decline position, where losing control of a dumbbell poses a safety risk.
