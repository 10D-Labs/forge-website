## How to perform

1. Sit on the ground with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor.
2. Lean back slightly while keeping your back straight and your core engaged.
3. Hold your hands together in front of your chest or hold a weight if desired.
4. Lift your feet off the ground, balancing on your sit bones.
5. Twist your torso to the right, bringing your hands or weight towards the right side of your body.
6. Pause for a moment, then twist your torso to the left, bringing your hands or weight towards the left side of your body.
7. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lean back to about a 45-degree angle and keep your chest up; rounding your back disengages the abs.
- Rotate from your ribcage, not just your arms; your shoulders should turn with your torso.
- Lift your feet off the ground only if you can maintain a stable torso angle without rocking.

## Common mistakes

- Just moving the arms side to side without actually rotating the torso, which means the obliques barely work.
- Rounding the back and collapsing the chest, which shifts load to the hip flexors instead of the core.
- Using a weight that's too heavy and losing the controlled rotation.

## FAQ

### Should I hold a weight during Russian Twists?

Start with bodyweight until you can do 15-20 reps per side with good form. Then add a light medicine ball or dumbbell. The movement should remain controlled with full rotation.

### Are Russian Twists safe for the lower back?

When done correctly (chest up, controlled tempo, no rounding), they're safe. If you have existing lower back issues, keep your feet on the ground and use a smaller range of rotation.

### Do Russian Twists work the obliques?

Yes, they primarily target the obliques through rotational movement. The rectus abdominis and hip flexors also work to maintain the seated V-position.

### What muscles does the Russian Twist work?

The Russian Twist primarily targets the abs, with secondary activation in the obliques. It's classified as a strength exercise for the core.

### Is the Russian Twist good for beginners?
