## How to perform

1. Adjust the machine to your desired resistance level.
2. Stand on the foot platform and grip the handles with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3. Hang with your arms fully extended, keeping your body straight.
4. Engage your back muscles and pull your body up towards the handles, leading with your chest.
5. Continue pulling until your chin is above the handles.
6. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your body back down to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Set the counterweight so you can complete 8-12 reps with good form. Too much assistance removes the challenge; too little leads to bad form.
- Pull your chin above the bar by driving your elbows down and back, initiating with the lats rather than the biceps.
- Lower yourself slowly (3 seconds) on each rep. The eccentric phase is where you build the most strength for eventual unassisted Chinups.

## Common mistakes

- Using too much counterweight (assistance), which makes the exercise too easy to build real strength.
- Kipping or jerking the body to get over the bar instead of using a controlled pull.
- Not going through a full range of motion by stopping before the chin clears the bar or not fully extending at the bottom.
