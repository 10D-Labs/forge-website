## How to perform

1. Attach the band to a sturdy anchor point at waist height.
2. Kneel down facing away from the anchor point and hold the band with both hands, keeping your elbows bent and close to your sides.
3. Engage your abs and slowly twist your torso to one side, bringing your hands towards your opposite hip.
4. Pause for a moment, then slowly return to the starting position.
5. Repeat on the other side.
6. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Rotate through your ribcage and bring your elbow toward the opposite knee to fully engage the obliques.
- Keep the band tension constant by not letting it go slack at any point during the movement.
- Perform all reps on one side before switching to the other for maximum oblique fatigue.

## Common mistakes

- Rotating only the arms and shoulders without engaging the torso, which bypasses the obliques.
- Rounding the entire spine instead of rotating through the thoracic spine specifically.
- Using too heavy a band, which causes the hip flexors to take over the crunching motion.

## FAQ

### What muscles do kneeling twisting crunches work?

Primarily the obliques and rectus abdominis. The twisting component increases oblique activation significantly compared to a standard crunch.

### How is this different from a cable woodchop?

The kneeling position removes the legs from the equation and the crunch element adds spinal flexion. Woodchops are more of a rotational power movement while this is a targeted core exercise.

### Can you do this exercise without a band?

Yes, but the band adds resistance to the rotation, making the obliques work harder. Without a band, you would need to use a cable machine or simply perform bodyweight twisting crunches.
