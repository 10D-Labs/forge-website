## How to perform

1. Position yourself on parallel bars with your arms fully extended and your body straight.
2. Lower your body by bending your elbows until your shoulders are below your elbows.
3. Push yourself back up to the starting position by straightening your arms.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lean your torso forward about 30 degrees and flare your elbows slightly outward to shift emphasis from the triceps to the chest.
- Lower yourself until your shoulders are at or slightly below your elbows. Going deeper stretches the pec fibers more and increases chest activation.
- At the top, do not lock out your elbows fully. Stop just short to maintain chest tension and reduce elbow joint stress.

## Common mistakes

- Staying too upright, which turns this into a Tricep Dip instead of a Chest Dip. You must lean forward to target the pecs.
- Not going deep enough. Partial reps at the top are tricep-dominant. The chest is recruited most heavily in the bottom stretched position.
- Swinging the legs and using momentum to Pushup, which reduces muscle engagement and can strain the shoulders.
