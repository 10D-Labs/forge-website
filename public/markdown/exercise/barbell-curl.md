## How to perform

1. Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a barbell with an underhand grip, palms facing forward.
2. Keep your elbows close to your torso and exhale as you curl the weights while contracting your biceps.
3. Continue to raise the bar until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level.
4. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
5. Inhale as you slowly begin to lower the bar back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your elbows pinned to your sides throughout the entire movement; they should not drift forward as you curl up.
- Lower the bar under control for 2-3 seconds to maximize the eccentric (negative) portion, which is a major driver of bicep growth.
- Squeeze your biceps hard at the top for a one-second hold before lowering.

## Common mistakes

- Swinging the hips and using body momentum to heave the bar up, which steals work from the biceps.
- Letting the elbows drift forward as you curl, which shortens the range of motion and reduces peak contraction.
- Loading too heavy and only performing partial reps in the middle range instead of a full stretch and full contraction.

## FAQ

### Should I use a straight bar or EZ curl bar for Barbell Curls?

An EZ curl bar is easier on the wrists and elbows for most people. A straight bar keeps the biceps in full supination, which can produce a slightly stronger contraction. Use whichever feels more comfortable.

### How much weight should I curl?

Most intermediate lifters curl 60-80 lbs for sets of 8-12. Start lighter and focus on strict form. If you need to swing or lean back, the weight is too heavy.

### How many sets of Barbell Curls should I do per week?

10-20 total sets of bicep work per week is optimal for most people. 3-4 sets of Barbell Curls 2-3 times per week, combined with other bicep exercises, covers this range well.
