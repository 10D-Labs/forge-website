## How to perform

1. Lie flat on a bench with your chest facing down and your arms extended straight down, holding a dumbbell in each hand.
2. Rotate your palms so they are facing up.
3. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the dumbbells as you rotate your palms to face down.
4. Inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use a very light dumbbell (2-5 lbs) since the pronator muscles are small and fatigue quickly.
- Rotate slowly and deliberately, focusing on the twisting motion from the forearm rather than moving the entire arm.
- Keep your upper arm and elbow completely stationary so the rotation occurs only at the forearm.

## Common mistakes

- Using too heavy a dumbbell, which forces the shoulder and upper arm to assist and removes the forearm isolation.
- Rushing through the rotations instead of performing slow, controlled pronation movements.
- Moving the entire arm instead of isolating the rotation to the wrist and forearm.
