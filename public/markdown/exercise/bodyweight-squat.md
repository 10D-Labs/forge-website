## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Lower your body by bending your knees and pushing your hips back as if sitting on a chair.
3. Keep your chest up and your back straight.
4. Lower yourself until your thighs are parallel to the ground.
5. Push through your heels to return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Screw your feet into the ground by externally rotating your hips, which activates your glutes and stabilizes your knees.
- Break at the hips and knees simultaneously rather than leading with one or the other.
- Hold your arms out in front for counterbalance if you tend to fall backward at the bottom.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the knees cave inward (valgus collapse) during the descent, especially at the bottom.
- Rising onto the toes because of limited ankle mobility, which shifts the center of gravity forward.
- Cutting depth short of parallel because of tight hips or ankles rather than addressing the mobility limitation.
