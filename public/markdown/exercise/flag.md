## How to perform

1. Start by gripping a vertical pole with both hands, palms facing each other, and arms fully extended.
2. Engage your core and lift your legs off the ground, keeping them straight.
3. Using your core and upper body strength, raise your legs until they are parallel to the ground.
4. Hold this position for as long as you can, maintaining a straight body line.
5. Slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Your bottom hand pushes the pole away while your top hand pulls, creating a push-pull force couple that holds you horizontal.
- Start with a tucked flag position and slowly extend your legs as you build the requisite oblique strength.
- Keep your body in a straight line from head to toe by actively squeezing your core and glutes.

## Common mistakes

- Trying to hold the flag with arm strength alone instead of engaging the entire lateral chain (obliques, lats, hips).
- Allowing the hips to drop, which creates a bent body line and significantly reduces the training effect.
- Choosing a pole that's too thick to grip securely, causing you to slip before your muscles actually fatigue.
