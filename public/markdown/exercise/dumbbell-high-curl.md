## How to perform

1. Stand up straight with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing forward.
2. Keep your upper arms stationary and curl the dumbbells as high as possible while contracting your biceps.
3. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Curl the dumbbells as high as possible toward your shoulders, bringing your fists close to the front deltoids.
- Keep your elbows pinned at your sides and resist the urge to swing them forward or outward at the top.
- Squeeze the biceps at the very top of the range for a full second before lowering.

## Common mistakes

- Using momentum to swing the dumbbells to the top instead of curling with controlled force.
- Letting the elbows drift forward, which turns the top portion into a front raise rather than a curl.
- Not reaching full height on the curl, which misses the peak contraction that gives this exercise its name.

Use moderate weight that allows you to reach full height with control. If you can't get the dumbbells to shoulder level without swinging, the weight is too heavy.

The Dumbbell High Curl primarily targets the biceps, with secondary activation in the forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.
