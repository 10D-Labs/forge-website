## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand.
2. Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight.
3. Extend your arms straight back, squeezing your triceps at the top of the movement.
4. Pause for a moment, then slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hinge at the hips with a flat back, keeping both upper arms locked at your sides, and extend both arms back simultaneously.
- Squeeze both triceps hard at full extension and hold for one second before lowering.
- Keep a slight bend in the knees to protect the lower back during the forward hinge.

## Common mistakes

- Standing too upright, which reduces the range of motion where gravity challenges the triceps.
- Swinging the dumbbells back using shoulder momentum rather than extending from the elbows.
- Dropping the upper arms below parallel during the movement, which reduces triceps activation.

## FAQ

Standing allows a deeper hip hinge and potentially more range of motion, but the lack of support makes cheating easier.

### How heavy should I go on standing kickbacks?

Light to moderate, 10-20 lbs per hand. The bilateral stance without support makes strict form harder to maintain with heavy weight.
