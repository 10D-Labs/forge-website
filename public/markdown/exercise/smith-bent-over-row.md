6. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the bar back down to the starting position.

## Pro tips

- Keep your torso at about a 45-degree angle and maintain this position strictly throughout the set.
- Drive your elbows back past your ribcage at the top of each rep for a full upper back contraction.

## Common mistakes

- Standing too far in front of or behind the bar, creating an awkward pulling angle that does not match natural row mechanics.
- Using the fixed bar path as an excuse to load too much weight and cheat with excessive body English.
- Rounding the upper back and letting the shoulders cave forward at the bottom of each rep.
