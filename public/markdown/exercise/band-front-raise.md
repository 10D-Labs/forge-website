## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold the band in front of your thighs with your palms facing down.
2. Keep your arms straight and slowly raise them forward until they are parallel to the ground.
3. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your arms back down to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Step on the center of the band and hold the ends with palms facing down for a standard front raise.
- Raise your arms to shoulder height and hold for a one-second pause before lowering.
- Keep your core tight and avoid rocking your torso to swing the band up.

## Common mistakes

- Using momentum by swinging the torso to lift the band instead of strict shoulder flexion.
- Raising the arms above shoulder height, which recruits the upper traps and reduces front delt isolation.
- Stepping too far forward on the band, creating so much tension that form breaks down.
