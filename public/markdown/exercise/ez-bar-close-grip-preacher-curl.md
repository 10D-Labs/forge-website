## How to perform

1. Sit on a preacher curl bench and place your upper arms on the pad, gripping the ez barbell with an underhand grip.
2. Rest your triceps on the pad and fully extend your arms, keeping your back straight.
3. Slowly curl the barbell towards your shoulders, contracting your biceps.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, squeezing your biceps.
5. Lower the barbell back to the starting position, fully extending your arms.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use the inner angled grips of the EZ bar for the close-grip position, which places more emphasis on the outer (long) head of the biceps.
- Keep your armpits pressed against the top of the preacher pad to lock your upper arms in place.
- Lower the bar until your arms are almost fully extended, but stop just short of lockout to keep tension on the biceps.

## Common mistakes

- Peeling the upper arms off the preacher pad at the top of the curl, which brings the shoulders into the movement.
- Slamming the arms to full lockout at the bottom, which puts dangerous stress on the elbow joint.
- Using too much weight and rocking the body to complete reps, defeating the isolation purpose of the preacher bench.

## FAQ

### What does a close grip do differently on Preacher Curls?

A close grip emphasizes the long (outer) head of the biceps, building the bicep peak. A wider grip targets the short (inner) head more.

### Should I go to full arm extension on Preacher Curls?

Stop just short of full extension to protect the elbow tendons and keep constant tension on the biceps. Going to full lockout under load increases injury risk.

### Can I do this with a straight bar instead of an EZ bar?

Yes, but the EZ bar's angled grips reduce wrist and forearm strain. If you don't have wrist issues, a straight bar works fine for close-grip Preacher Curls.

The EZ Bar Close Grip Preacher Curl primarily targets the biceps, with secondary activation in the forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.
