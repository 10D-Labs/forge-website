## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with your back straight and feet flat on the ground.
2. Hold the barbell with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3. Lift the barbell off the rack and bring it to shoulder level, with your elbows bent and palms facing forward.
4. Press the barbell overhead by extending your arms fully.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the barbell back to shoulder level.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Press the bar in a slight arc up and back so it finishes directly over the crown of your head, not in front of your face.
- Keep your core tight and avoid excessive arching of the lower back; the seat back should support you but not become a decline bench.
- Lower the bar to your upper chest or chin level before pressing, ensuring a full range of motion.

## Common mistakes

- Arching the lower back excessively to turn it into an incline press, which stresses the lumbar spine and reduces shoulder work.
- Pressing the bar forward in front of your head instead of directly overhead, which is less efficient and harder on the shoulders.
- Not lowering the bar enough, doing partial reps that limit shoulder development.
