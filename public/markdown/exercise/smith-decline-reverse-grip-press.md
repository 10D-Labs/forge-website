## How to perform

1. Adjust the smith machine to a decline position.
2. Lie down on the bench with your feet secured under the foot pads.
3. Grasp the barbell with a reverse grip, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
4. Unrack the barbell and lower it towards your chest, keeping your elbows tucked in.
5. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push the barbell back up to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Grip the bar with a supinated (underhand) grip about shoulder-width apart for the best upper chest and tricep activation.
- Lower the bar to your lower sternum and keep your elbows tight to your body.
- Use a lighter weight than your standard decline press until you're comfortable with the reverse grip.

## Common mistakes

- Gripping too wide with the reverse grip, which puts the wrists in an awkward and potentially painful position.
- Not warming up the wrists and forearms before the exercise, which can lead to strain with the supinated grip.
- Using the same weight as a standard bench press; the reverse grip is inherently weaker, so start light.
