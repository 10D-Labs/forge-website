## How to perform

1. Lie flat on a decline bench with your feet secured under the foot pads.
2. Place your hands behind your head or across your chest.
3. Engage your abs and slowly lift your upper body off the bench, curling forward until your torso is perpendicular to the ground.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your upper body back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hold the weight plate or dumbbell against your chest, not behind your head, to reduce neck strain.
- Curl up one vertebra at a time rather than hinging at the hips to maximize abdominal engagement.
- Control the descent (3-4 seconds) to get the most from the eccentric phase.

## Common mistakes

- Holding the weight behind the head, which strains the neck and uses momentum from the arms.
- Using the hip flexors to swing up quickly instead of curling through the spine.
- Setting the decline angle too steep, which can cause blood to rush to the head and shifts work to the hip flexors.
