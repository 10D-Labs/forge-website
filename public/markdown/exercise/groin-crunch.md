5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Splay your knees out to the sides in a butterfly position with the soles of your feet together to relax the hip flexors and force the abs to do the work.
- Focus on curling your ribcage toward your pelvis rather than just lifting your head and shoulders.
- Exhale fully at the top of each crunch to maximally contract the rectus abdominis.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling on the neck with the hands, which strains the cervical spine and reduces ab engagement.
- Using hip flexor momentum to lift the legs rather than initiating the movement with the abs.
- Not going through a full range of motion by only partially lifting the shoulders off the ground.
