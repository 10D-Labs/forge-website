## How to perform

1. Sit on the floor with your legs extended in front of you.
2. Lean back slightly and lift your legs off the ground, keeping them straight.
3. Simultaneously, lift your upper body off the ground and reach your arms towards your legs.
4. Hold this position for a few seconds, then slowly lower your upper body and legs back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lean back slightly and press through your palms to counterbalance the weight of your raised legs.
- Lift your legs as high as possible while keeping them straight; the higher the angle, the harder the compression.
- Engage your hip flexors by pulling your knees toward your face, not just lifting your feet.

## Common mistakes

- Rounding the upper back excessively to compensate for tight hamstrings, which collapses the hold.
- Bending the knees to get the legs higher instead of working on compression flexibility.
- Holding your breath during the hold instead of taking controlled, shallow breaths.
