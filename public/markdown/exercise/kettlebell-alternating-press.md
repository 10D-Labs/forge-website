## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a kettlebell in each hand at shoulder height.
2. Press one kettlebell overhead, fully extending your arm.
3. Lower the kettlebell back to shoulder height.
4. Repeat with the other arm.
5. Continue alternating arms for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Brace your core hard on every rep to prevent lateral lean as you press one side at a time.
- Press the kettlebell in a slight arc from shoulder to directly overhead, finishing with your bicep near your ear.
- Lower the kettlebell under control to shoulder height before pressing the opposite side.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning to the opposite side during the press to compensate for the load, which stresses the spine.
- Pressing both kettlebells simultaneously instead of alternating, which misses the anti-lateral flexion core challenge.
- Not fully locking out overhead before switching sides.
