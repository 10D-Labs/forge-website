## How to perform

1. Start by standing with one foot on a platform or slide board.
2. Bend your knee slightly and slide the foot on the platform backward, extending your leg.
3. Keep your core engaged and maintain a straight posture throughout the movement.
4. Slowly return to the starting position by sliding your foot back to the initial position.
5. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions, then switch legs.

## Pro tips

- Keep your standing knee slightly bent and your weight centered over the standing foot throughout the slide.
- Slide the foot back slowly and with control; speed reduces the eccentric hamstring and glute benefit.
- Maintain an upright torso and avoid leaning forward excessively as the leg extends behind you.

## Common mistakes

- Sliding too far back and losing control, which can strain the hamstrings or groin.
- Rounding the back as you slide, which shifts load off the glutes and hamstrings and onto the lower back.
- Letting the standing knee cave inward, indicating weak hip stabilizers.
