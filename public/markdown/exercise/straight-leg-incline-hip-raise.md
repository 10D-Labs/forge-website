## How to perform

1. Lie on an incline bench with your back flat against the bench and your legs extended straight out in front of you.
2. Place your hands on the sides of the bench for support.
3. Engaging your abs, lift your legs off the bench, raising them as high as you can while keeping them straight.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Grip the top of the incline bench firmly overhead to anchor your upper body and allow full focus on the abs.
- Lift your legs by curling your pelvis off the bench rather than just swinging your legs up with hip flexors.
- Lower your legs slowly (3-4 seconds) to increase time under tension and prevent momentum from building.

## Common mistakes

- Using the incline to swing the legs up with momentum instead of performing controlled raises.
- Not lifting the hips off the bench at the top of the movement, which means the hip flexors are doing most of the work.
- Letting the lower back arch off the bench at the bottom, which causes lumbar stress.
