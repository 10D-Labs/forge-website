## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with your feet flat on the ground and hold a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing up.
2. Rest your upper arms on your thighs, allowing the dumbbells to hang down.
3. Keeping your upper arms stationary, curl the dumbbells up towards your shoulders by contracting your biceps.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Rest your upper arms on your inner thighs to create a makeshift preacher pad that isolates the biceps.
- Curl the dumbbells with palms facing up, squeezing hard at the top where the biceps are fully shortened.
- Lower slowly to a full arm extension to maximize the eccentric stretch on the biceps.

## Common mistakes

- Lifting the upper arms off the thighs during the curl, which removes the bracing and allows momentum.
- Rounding the back to reach the dumbbells at the bottom instead of maintaining an upright seated posture.
- Curling too fast and using momentum, which reduces bicep isolation in this supported position.
