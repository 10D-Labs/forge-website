## How to perform

1. Set up a suspension trainer at an appropriate height.
2. Stand facing the anchor point with your feet shoulder-width apart.
3. Hold the handles with an overhand grip, palms facing each other.
4. Lean back, keeping your body straight and your heels on the ground.
5. Pull your chest towards the handles, squeezing your shoulder blades together.
6. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower yourself back to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your body in a rigid plank from head to heels throughout the pull and don't let your hips sag.
- Pull the handles to the outside of your ribcage and squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top.
- Walk your feet further under the anchor to increase difficulty; the more horizontal your body, the harder the row.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the hips sag or pike during the row, which takes tension off the back muscles.
- Pulling with the arms (biceps) instead of initiating with the back (retracting the shoulder blades).
- Standing too upright, which makes the exercise too easy and reduces back muscle engagement.
