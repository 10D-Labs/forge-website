## How to perform

1. Anchor your feet under a stable surface, situp bench, or weight.
2. Lie flat on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground.
3. Place your hands behind your head with your elbows pointing outwards, or cross them over your chest.
4. Engaging your abs, slowly lift your upper body off the ground, curling forward until your torso is upright.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your upper body back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Anchor your feet securely and cross your arms over your chest or place hands behind your head without pulling on your neck.
- Curl up by flexing your spine from the top down, starting with your chin and chest before your lower back leaves the floor.
- Control the descent back to the ground rather than dropping; the eccentric phase builds core strength.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling on the neck with your hands to help lift the torso, which strains the cervical spine.
- Using hip flexors to yank yourself up rather than curling with the abs.
- Anchoring the feet but relying entirely on the anchor to generate force rather than using core strength.

## FAQ

### Are situps bad for your back?

Not inherently, but repeated full situps with poor form can stress the lumbar discs. If you have back issues, crunches or Dead Bugs may be safer alternatives.

### What is the difference between a situp and a crunch?

A situp brings your entire torso off the ground by flexing at both the spine and hips. A crunch only lifts the shoulders and upper back, isolating the abs with less hip flexor involvement.

### How many situps should I do per day?

For core development, 3-4 sets of 15-20 reps, 3-4 times per week is sufficient. Daily high-volume situps aren't necessary and can lead to hip flexor tightness.

### What muscles does the Situp work?

The Situp primarily targets the abs, with secondary activation in the hip flexors. It's classified as a strength exercise for the core.

### Is the Situp good for beginners?

Yes, the Situp is rated as a beginner-level exercise. It's a great starting point for building abs strength.
