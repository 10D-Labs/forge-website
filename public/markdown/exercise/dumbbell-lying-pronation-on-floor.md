## How to perform

1. Lie flat on the floor with your face down and your arms extended straight out in front of you, holding a dumbbell in each hand.
2. Rotate your palms so they are facing down towards the floor.
3. Keeping your arms straight, lift the dumbbells off the floor by contracting your forearms.
4. Continue lifting until your forearms are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level.
5. Hold for a moment, then slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your upper arm stationary on the floor and rotate only your forearm to isolate the pronator muscles.
- Use very light dumbbells (2-5 lbs) since the pronator muscles are small and fatigue quickly.
- Perform the rotation slowly and deliberately for 2-3 seconds in each direction to build forearm control.

## Common mistakes

- Using the shoulder to rotate the arm instead of isolating the forearm rotation at the wrist and elbow.
- Using too heavy a weight, which recruits larger muscles and bypasses the forearm pronators entirely.
- Rushing through the reps instead of controlling the rotation, which reduces the strengthening benefit.
