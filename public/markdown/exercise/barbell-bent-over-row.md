## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent.
2. Bend forward at the hips while keeping your back straight and chest up.
3. Grasp the barbell with an overhand grip, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
4. Pull the barbell towards your lower chest by retracting your shoulder blades and squeezing your back muscles.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hinge until your torso is roughly 45-60 degrees from the floor and maintain this angle throughout; your back should not rise and fall with each rep.
- Pull the barbell toward your lower chest or upper abdomen, driving your elbows past your torso and squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top.
- Brace your core hard before each rep to protect your lower back and maintain a neutral spine.

## Common mistakes

- Rising up with the torso on each rep (turning it into a partial shrug/row hybrid), which uses momentum instead of back muscles.
- Rounding the lower back under load, which puts the lumbar spine at risk for injury.
- Pulling the bar to the stomach with loose shoulder blades instead of retracting them first, reducing upper back activation.
