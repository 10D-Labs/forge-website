4. Engage your core and lift the barbell by extending your hips and knees, pulling your shoulders back and squeezing your glutes at the top.
5. Lower the barbell back down to the starting position by bending at the hips and knees.

## Pro tips

- Set the rack pins at knee height to focus on the lockout portion of the Deadlift and overload the glutes and traps.
- Pull the slack out of the bar by engaging your lats before driving through the floor with your legs.
- Lock out aggressively by squeezing your glutes and pulling your shoulders back at the top.

## Common mistakes

- Setting the pins too low, which essentially turns it into a deficit Deadlift rather than a lockout-focused exercise.
- Rounding the upper back to handle heavier weight, which can cause injury despite the shortened range of motion.
- Hyperextending the lower back at the top instead of achieving lockout through hip extension.

## FAQ

### What's the point of rack pulls if I already Deadlift?

### At what height should I set the pins?

Just below or at knee height is standard. Below the knee focuses on the mid-pull, at the knee targets the lockout. Above the knee is a very short range of motion useful mainly for grip work.

### Can rack pulls replace Deadlifts?

No. They don't train the initial pull off the floor, which is a critical portion of the Deadlift. Use rack pulls as a supplemental exercise alongside regular Deadlifts.
