## FAQ

### Is the Seated Leg Curl better than the Lying Leg Curl?

Pointing your toes slightly down (plantarflexion) reduces calf involvement and places more tension on the hamstrings. Pointing toes up shifts some load to the calves.

Lower the weight, tighten the thigh pad so it sits firmly above your knees, and focus on curling with control rather than jerking the weight.
