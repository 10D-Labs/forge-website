## Pro tips

- Lean forward with your free hand on the bench and raise the dumbbell out to the side, leading with the elbow.
- Keep a slight bend in your working elbow and focus on squeezing the rear delt and rhomboid at the top.
- Pause at the top for one second to ensure you are not relying on momentum for the lift.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling the dumbbell toward the hip in a row pattern rather than raising it laterally, which shifts work to the lats.
- Rounding the back during the movement, which reduces rear delt activation and stresses the spine.
- Using too much weight and swinging the dumbbell with body rotation instead of strict rear delt contraction.
