## How to perform

1. Set up an incline bench at a 45 degree angle.
2. Sit on the bench with your chest against the backrest and hold a dumbbell in each hand.
3. Extend your arms straight down with your palms facing each other.
4. Keeping a slight bend in your elbows, raise your arms out to the sides until they are parallel to the ground.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your arms back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Press your chest firmly into the incline bench to eliminate any cheating and isolate the rear delts completely.
- Think about driving your elbows toward the ceiling rather than lifting the dumbbells, which cues better rear delt activation.
- Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement for a one-second hold to maximize rhomboid and rear delt engagement.

## Common mistakes

- Lifting the chest off the bench to use body momentum, which turns this into a Bent Over Row and reduces rear delt isolation.
- Pulling with the biceps instead of leading with the elbows, which shifts work away from the posterior delts.
- Raising the arms too high past parallel, which recruits the upper traps and takes tension off the rear delts.
