## How to perform

1. Set up an incline bench at a 45 degree angle.
2. Lie face down on the bench with your chest and stomach resting against it.
3. Hold a barbell with an underhand grip, shoulder-width apart.
4. Extend your arms fully, allowing the barbell to hang down towards the floor.
5. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps.
6. Continue to raise the barbell until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level.
7. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
8. Inhale and slowly begin to lower the barbell back to the starting position.
9. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Let your arms hang straight down with zero swing at the start of each rep to ensure a full range of motion.
- The incline position prevents any body momentum, so use lighter weight than you would for standing curls.
- Squeeze the biceps hard at the top and resist the urge to let the bar drop quickly during the lowering phase.

## Common mistakes

- Setting the incline too steep, which reduces the range of motion and makes the exercise easier.
- Swinging the legs or shifting the hips on the bench to create momentum.
- Not fully extending the arms at the bottom, shortening the range and reducing the stretch stimulus.

## FAQ

### What's the benefit of doing curls face down on an incline?

The prone position eliminates all body momentum and gravity assistance, forcing strict bicep isolation. It also puts the long head of the biceps in a more stretched position, which stimulates more growth.

### How much less weight will I use compared to standing curls?

Expect to use 50-70% of your standing Barbell Curl weight. The complete removal of momentum makes this exercise significantly harder per pound.

### At what angle should the incline bench be set?

30-45 degrees works best. This angle lets your arms hang freely without the bar hitting the bench or the floor.

### What muscles does the Barbell Prone Incline Curl work?

The Barbell Prone Incline Curl primarily targets the biceps, with secondary activation in the forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.

### Is the Barbell Prone Incline Curl good for beginners?

The Barbell Prone Incline Curl is rated as intermediate. Beginners should build a base of biceps strength with easier variations first.
