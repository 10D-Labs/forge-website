## How to perform

1. Lie flat on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground.
2. Place your hands behind your head with your elbows pointing outwards.
3. Engaging your abs, slowly lift your upper body off the ground, curling forward until your torso is at a 45 degree angle.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your upper body back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Start lying flat with arms extended overhead and legs straight. Simultaneously bring your knees to your chest and your arms forward, curling into a ball.
- Focus on contracting your abs to pull everything inward, not just swinging your limbs toward each other.
- Slowly extend back to the fully stretched position on each rep. The eccentric phase is where the abs work hardest to resist gravity.

## Common mistakes

- Using momentum by swinging the arms and legs together rather than contracting the abs to curl the body.
- Not fully extending back to the start position, which shortens the range of motion and reduces the stretch on the abs.
- Lifting with the hip flexors instead of the abs. If you feel it in your hip crease more than your midsection, slow down and focus on the spinal curl.
