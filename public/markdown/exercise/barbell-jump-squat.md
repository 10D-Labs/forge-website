## How to perform

1. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a barbell across your upper back.
2. Lower your body into a squat position by bending your knees and pushing your hips back.
3. Once you reach the bottom of the squat, explode upwards by jumping off the ground.
4. As you jump, extend your hips, knees, and ankles, pushing through your toes.
5. Land softly back into the squat position and immediately repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use only 20-30% of your back squat max; this is a speed and power exercise, not a strength exercise.
- Land softly by bending your knees and absorbing the impact through your quads and glutes, then immediately drop into the next squat.
- Explode out of the bottom position as fast as possible; the intent to move fast is what builds power.

## Common mistakes

- Using too much weight, which slows the jump and negates the explosive training benefit.
- Landing with stiff legs and a hard impact, which transmits dangerous forces through the spine and knees.
- Not squatting deep enough before jumping, which limits power output and glute involvement.
