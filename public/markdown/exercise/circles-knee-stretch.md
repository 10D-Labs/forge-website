## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your hands on your hips.
2. Bend your knees slightly and lift your heels off the ground, balancing on the balls of your feet.
3. Keeping your knees bent, rotate your knees in a circular motion, first clockwise and then counterclockwise.
4. Perform the movement for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Make small, controlled circles with your knees, keeping your feet close together and flat on the ground for stability.
- Perform equal circles in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions to mobilize all aspects of the knee joint evenly.
- Keep the movement gentle and within a pain-free range. This is a mobility drill, not a strengthening exercise.

- Making circles too large, which can strain the knee ligaments, especially if they are already compromised.
- Moving too quickly through the circles, which reduces the mobility benefit and increases the risk of tweaking the knee.
- Putting too much weight on the knees by leaning forward excessively instead of keeping the weight centered.
