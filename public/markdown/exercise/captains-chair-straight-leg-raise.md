## How to perform

1. Sit on the captain's chair with your back against the backrest and your forearms resting on the arm pads.
2. Keep your upper body stable and your back straight.
3. Engage your abs and lift your legs up in front of you, keeping them straight.
4. Continue lifting until your legs are parallel to the ground or as high as you can comfortably go.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your legs completely straight and lift them by contracting your abs, not by swinging.
- Press your back firmly against the backrest and avoid arching away from it during the lift.
- Lower your legs slowly for a 3-second eccentric to maximize ab engagement and reduce momentum.

## Common mistakes

- Swinging the legs up with momentum instead of using controlled ab contraction, which reduces the training effect.
- Bending the knees as the legs rise, which shortens the lever arm and makes the exercise significantly easier.
- Arching the back away from the pad, which shifts stress to the hip flexors and lower back.

Yes, EMG studies consistently show captain's chair leg raises as one of the most effective exercises for rectus abdominis and oblique activation.
