## How to perform

1. Sit on the edge of a chair or bench with your hands next to your hips, fingers pointing forward.
2. Slide your butt off the front of the chair with your legs extended in front of you.
3. Straighten your arms, keeping a little bend in your elbows to keep tension on your triceps and off your elbow joints.
4. Slowly bend your elbows to lower your body toward the floor until your elbows are at about a 90 degree angle.
5. Once you reach the bottom of the movement, press down into the chair to straighten your elbows, returning to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Plant your hands firmly on the floor directly under your shoulders with fingers pointing toward your feet.
- Keep your hips as close to your hands as possible throughout the movement to maintain tension on the triceps.
- Bend your knees to make it easier or straighten your legs to increase the difficulty.

## Common mistakes

- Placing hands too far behind the body, which puts unnecessary strain on the wrists and shoulders.
- Moving the hips forward and backward instead of straight up and down, turning it into a rocking motion.
- Not achieving enough range of motion by only doing partial reps at the top.
