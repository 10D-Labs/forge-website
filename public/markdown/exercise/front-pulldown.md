## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height and position yourself on the machine with your knees under the pads and your feet flat on the ground.
2. Grasp the handles with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3. Sit upright with your chest lifted and your shoulders back, maintaining a slight arch in your lower back.
4. Engage your lats and pull the handles down towards your chest, squeezing your shoulder blades together.
5. Pause for a moment at the bottom of the movement, then slowly release the handles back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lean back slightly (about 10-15 degrees) and pull the bar to your upper chest, not behind your neck.
- Initiate the pull by depressing your shoulder blades (pulling them down) before bending your elbows.
- Squeeze your lats at the bottom and control the return for 2-3 seconds, feeling the stretch at the top.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning too far back and turning the pulldown into a rowing motion.
- Pulling with the biceps instead of initiating with the lats by depressing the shoulder blades first.
- Using too much weight and only pulling halfway down, missing the peak lat contraction.

## FAQ

### Should I pull behind the neck or to the front?

Pull to the front (upper chest). Behind-the-neck pulldowns put the shoulders in a vulnerable externally rotated and abducted position under load, increasing injury risk without additional muscle benefit.

### How wide should I grip the pulldown bar?

Slightly wider than shoulder width (about 1.5x shoulder width) is optimal for lat engagement. Too wide reduces range of motion; too narrow shifts the work to the biceps and lower traps.

### What muscles does the Front Pulldown work?

The Front Pulldown primarily targets the lats, with secondary activation in the biceps, rhomboids, rear deltoids. It's classified as a strength exercise for the back.

### Is the Front Pulldown good for beginners?
