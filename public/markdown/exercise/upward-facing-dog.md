## Pro tips

- Press firmly through your palms and lift your thighs and knees completely off the floor, not just your chest.
- Roll your shoulders back and down, opening the chest wide while keeping the neck long and neutral.
- Engage your quads to keep your legs active and lifted, distributing the extension through the entire spine rather than hinging at the lower back.

## Common mistakes

- Leaving the thighs on the ground, which turns it into a cobra pose and reduces the full-body engagement.
- Dumping all the extension into the lower back by not engaging the legs and core.
- Shrugging the shoulders up toward the ears instead of pulling them down and back.
