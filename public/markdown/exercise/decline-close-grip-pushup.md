## How to perform

1. Place your hands on an elevated surface, such as a bench or step, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
2. Extend your legs behind you, resting on the balls of your feet, with your body forming a straight line from head to heels.
3. Lower your chest towards the elevated surface by bending your elbows, keeping them close to your sides.
4. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push yourself back up to the starting position by straightening your arms.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Place your hands directly under your shoulders (or slightly narrower) with fingers pointing forward to maximize triceps engagement.
- Keep your elbows tucked tight to your sides throughout the push to maintain triceps emphasis over chest.
- Elevate your feet on a bench or step at least 12 inches high to increase the load on your upper body.

## Common mistakes

- Flaring the elbows out wide, which shifts emphasis from triceps to chest and shoulders.
- Letting the hips sag, which stresses the lower back and reduces core engagement.
- Placing the hands too wide apart, turning this into a regular Decline Pushup rather than a triceps-focused variation.
