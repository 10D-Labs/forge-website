## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and grasp the handles of the cable machine with an overhand grip.
2. Position your hands at shoulder height, with your palms facing forward.
3. Keep your core engaged and your back straight.
4. Press one handle up and forward until your arm is fully extended.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the handle back to the starting position.
6. Repeat with the other arm.
7. Alternate between arms for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Stand centered between the cable columns and press one arm at a time, allowing your torso to rotate slightly for natural pressing mechanics.
- Set the pulleys at shoulder height so the pressing angle matches a standard shoulder press.
- Control the eccentric (lowering) portion for 2 seconds on each arm to maximize shoulder time under tension.

## Common mistakes

- Setting the pulleys too low, which turns it into more of an incline press than a shoulder press.
- Leaning too far to one side during the single-arm press, which uses body weight instead of shoulder strength.
- Pressing both arms simultaneously instead of alternating, which negates the unilateral stability benefit.

## FAQ

### What's the advantage of Cable Shoulder Press over dumbbells?

Cables provide constant tension throughout the entire range of motion, including the top of the press where dumbbells become easier due to the lockout position. The alternating pattern also builds anti-rotation core stability.

### Can Cable Shoulder Presses replace barbell overhead press?

They're a good supplement but don't fully replace the barbell press for building maximal shoulder strength. The barbell allows heavier loading. Use both for complete shoulder development.

### What weight should I start with on Cable Shoulder Press?

Start with about 60-70% of what you'd use for a dumbbell shoulder press. The constant cable tension makes the exercise feel harder than free weights at the same load.

### What muscles does the Cable Alternate Shoulder Press work?

The Cable Alternate Shoulder Press primarily targets the shoulders, with secondary activation in the triceps, upper back. It's classified as a strength exercise for the shoulders.

### Is the Cable Alternate Shoulder Press good for beginners?

The Cable Alternate Shoulder Press is rated as intermediate. Beginners should build a base of shoulders strength with easier variations first.
