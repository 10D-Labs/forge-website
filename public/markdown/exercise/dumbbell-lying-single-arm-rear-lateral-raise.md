## How to perform

1. Lie face down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in one hand, hanging towards the floor.
2. Keep your arm straight and lift the dumbbell out to the side, away from your body.
3. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbell back down to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch to the other arm.

## Pro tips

- Press your chest firmly into the bench and keep your working arm slightly bent as you raise the dumbbell out to the side.
- Focus on squeezing the rear delt at the top rather than just lifting the weight, pausing for one second at parallel.
- Train one arm at a time to concentrate on the mind-muscle connection with each rear delt individually.

## Common mistakes

- Lifting the torso off the bench to cheat the weight up, which recruits the lower back and reduces rear delt isolation.
- Pulling the dumbbell back toward the hip instead of out to the side, which turns this into a row rather than a rear Lateral Raise.
- Going too heavy, since the rear delt is a small muscle that responds better to controlled lighter loads.
