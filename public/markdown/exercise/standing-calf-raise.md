## How to perform

1. Adjust the machine to your height and stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Place your shoulders under the pads and hold onto the handles for stability.
3. Raise your heels as high as possible by extending your ankles.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your heels back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Rise all the way up onto your toes and pause at the top for a 2-second squeeze to maximize gastrocnemius activation.
- Lower your heels below the platform level on each rep to get a full stretch at the bottom.
- Keep your knees straight but not locked to keep the emphasis on the gastrocnemius rather than the soleus.

## Common mistakes

- Bouncing at the bottom of the rep instead of pausing and using a controlled tempo.
- Bending the knees during the movement, which shifts tension from the calves to the quads.
- Using too much weight and only achieving a partial range of motion.

## FAQ

### How many reps should I do for Standing Calf Raises?

Calves are endurance muscles and respond well to higher reps. Aim for 12-20 reps per set with a slow, controlled tempo. Some people benefit from even higher reps (20-30).

### What's the difference between standing and Seated Calf Raises?

Standing Calf Raises primarily target the gastrocnemius (the larger, visible calf muscle) because the knees are straight. Seated Calf Raises target the soleus (the muscle underneath) because the knees are bent.

### Should I change foot position on calf raises?

Toes pointed straight is the standard and most effective position. Slight variations (toes in or out) may shift emphasis marginally, but the difference is small. Focus on full range of motion instead.

### What muscles does the Standing Calf Raise work?

The Standing Calf Raise primarily targets the calves, with secondary activation in the soleus, ankle stabilizers. It's classified as a strength exercise for the legs.

### Is the Standing Calf Raise good for beginners?
