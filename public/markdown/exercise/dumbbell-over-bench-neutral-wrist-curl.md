## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with your feet flat on the ground and hold a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing up.
2. Rest your forearms on the bench, allowing your wrists to hang off the edge.
3. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the dumbbells up towards your shoulders.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Drape your forearms over the bench edge with a neutral (thumbs-up) grip and let your wrists hang freely for full range.
- Curl the dumbbells upward by flexing the wrists, squeezing at the top to engage the brachioradialis.
- Keep your forearms pressed firmly against the bench surface throughout to isolate the wrist and forearm muscles.

## Common mistakes

- Allowing the forearms to lift off the bench, which introduces bicep curling instead of pure wrist flexion.
- Using a grip that rotates to palms-up or palms-down, losing the neutral position that targets the brachioradialis.
- Jerking the weight up with fast reps instead of using controlled movements that keep tension on the forearm.
