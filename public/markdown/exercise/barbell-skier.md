## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a barbell in front of your thighs with an overhand grip.
2. Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight and chest up.
3. Simultaneously lift the barbell up towards your shoulders while jumping slightly off the ground.
4. As you reach the top of the movement, quickly reverse the motion and lower the barbell back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use an explosive hip drive to propel the bar upward, similar to the motion of jumping off a ski slope.
- Keep the bar close to your body throughout and land softly with bent knees if your feet leave the ground.
- Start with very light weight to learn the timing and coordination of the jump-shrug movement.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling with the arms instead of driving with the hips and legs, reducing the explosive training benefit.
- Landing with stiff legs after the jump portion, which sends shock through the knees and spine.
- Not bending the knees enough at the start, which limits the power generated from the legs.
