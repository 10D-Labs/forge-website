## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder height with your palms facing down.
2. Keeping your core engaged and your elbows slightly bent, press the dumbbells up and overhead until your arms are fully extended.
3. Rotate your wrists so that your palms are facing forward.
4. Slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position, rotating your wrists back to the starting position as you do so.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Start by rowing the dumbbells up with your elbows leading until your upper arms are parallel to the floor, then externally rotate your forearms upward, then press overhead. This three-part movement trains shoulder strength and mobility.
- Use very light weight. The external rotation phase is the weakest link and can strain the rotator cuff with heavy loads.
- Perform the movement slowly and deliberately, pausing at each transition (row, rotate, press) to maintain control.

## Common mistakes

- Using too much weight, which compromises the external rotation phase and can injure the rotator cuff.
- Skipping the external rotation and going straight from the upright row to the press, which eliminates the rotator cuff benefit.
- Performing the movement too quickly and using momentum instead of controlled muscle engagement.
