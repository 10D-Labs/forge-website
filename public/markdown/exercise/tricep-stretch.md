## How to perform

1. Stand or sit upright with your back straight.
2. Extend one arm overhead, bending it at the elbow.
3. Place your opposite hand on the bent elbow and gently pull it towards your head.
4. Hold the stretch for 15-30 seconds, feeling a gentle stretch in your triceps.
5. Release the stretch and repeat on the other arm.

## Pro tips

- Gently press your elbow with the opposite hand rather than yanking it to avoid overstretching the joint.
- Keep your spine tall and avoid arching your lower back as you reach the arm overhead.
- Breathe deeply and hold for at least 20 seconds per side to allow the muscle to fully relax and lengthen.

## Common mistakes

- Tilting the head forward or to the side, which changes spinal alignment and reduces the effectiveness of the stretch.
- Pulling the elbow too aggressively, which can strain the shoulder joint rather than stretch the tricep.
- Rushing through the stretch without holding long enough for any real tissue benefit.
