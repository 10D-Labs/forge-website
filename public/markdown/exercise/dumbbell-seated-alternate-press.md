## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing forward.
2. Raise the dumbbells to shoulder height, with your elbows bent and palms facing forward.
3. Press one dumbbell up overhead, fully extending your arm.
4. Lower the dumbbell back down to shoulder height.
5. Repeat with the other arm.
6. Continue alternating arms for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Alternate pressing one arm at a time while keeping the other dumbbell at shoulder height, which doubles the time under tension per set.
- Brace your core and press straight up over each shoulder, not toward the center of your body.
- Keep the non-pressing arm engaged at shoulder height rather than resting it, which maintains constant tension.

## Common mistakes

- Resting the non-working arm on the thigh between reps instead of keeping it at shoulder height, which removes constant tension.
- Leaning to one side as you press, which stresses the spine laterally.
- Pressing the dumbbell forward instead of straight overhead, which shifts the load to the front delt.
