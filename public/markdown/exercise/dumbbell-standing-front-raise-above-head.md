## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand with an overhand grip.
2. Keep your arms straight and lift the dumbbells in front of you, raising them above your head.
3. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Raise the dumbbells in front of you all the way overhead in one smooth arc, which increases the range of motion beyond a standard front raise.
- Keep your arms straight (slight elbow bend) and core braced to prevent your back from arching as the weight goes overhead.
- Lower the dumbbells slowly through the same arc, resisting gravity all the way back to your thighs.

## Common mistakes

- Arching the lower back excessively as the dumbbells go above shoulder height, which compresses the lumbar spine.
- Using momentum to swing the dumbbells overhead instead of lifting with controlled delt and trap contraction.
- Going too heavy for the extended overhead range of motion, which compromises form and strains the shoulders.
