## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing your body.
2. Raise your arms out to the sides until they are parallel to the ground, keeping your elbows slightly bent.
3. Rotate your arms externally, bringing the dumbbells up towards your head while keeping your elbows in the same position.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Start with arms at 90 degrees out to the side (scarecrow position) and rotate the forearms from pointing down to pointing up.
- Keep the elbows at shoulder height throughout and do not let them drop as you fatigue.
- Use 3-5 pound dumbbells to start; this exercise is about rotator cuff conditioning, not strength.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the elbows drop below shoulder height, which changes the angle and reduces rotator cuff activation.
- Using momentum to swing the dumbbells into the rotated position instead of controlling the rotation.
- Shrugging the shoulders up during the movement, which engages the traps rather than the rotator cuff.
