## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent.
2. Grasp the barbell with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3. Lift the barbell off the rack and bring it down to shoulder level, with your palms facing forward.
4. Press the barbell upward until your arms are fully extended overhead.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the barbell back down to shoulder level.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Start with the bar at shoulder height and press straight up, finishing with the bar directly over the crown of your head.
- Squeeze your glutes and brace your core to prevent the lower back from arching during the press.
- Use a staggered stance (one foot slightly forward) for better balance during the standing press.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning back excessively, which turns the overhead press into a standing incline press and compresses the lumbar spine.
- Pressing the bar too far forward or behind the head instead of directly overhead.
- Using leg drive (push pressing) when the goal is a strict Military Press.

## FAQ

### What's the difference between a Military Press and a regular shoulder press?

The Military Press traditionally involves a strict stance (heels together) with no leg drive, making it a pure shoulder strength exercise. The Smith version fixes the bar path, so focus on strict pressing form.

### Is the standing Military Press better than seated?

Standing engages the core, glutes, and stabilizers more, making it a more functional movement. Seated isolates the shoulders and allows heavier loads. Both have value.

### How do I protect my lower back during standing overhead pressing?

Squeeze your glutes like you're holding a coin between your cheeks, brace your abs as if expecting a punch, and avoid leaning back. If you can't press the weight without leaning, it's too heavy.

### What muscles does the Smith Standing Military Press work?

The Smith Standing Military Press primarily targets the shoulders, with secondary activation in the triceps, upper back. It's classified as a strength exercise for the shoulders.

### Is the Smith Standing Military Press good for beginners?

The Smith Standing Military Press is rated as intermediate. Beginners should build a base of shoulders strength with easier variations first.
