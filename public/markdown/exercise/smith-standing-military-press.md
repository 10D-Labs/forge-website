# Smith Standing Military Press - Forge Exercise Library

## Quick Answer

The Smith standing military press is a compound exercise targeting the deltoid muscles of the shoulders, performed using a Smith machine for added stability. It also engages the tricep and upper back as secondary muscles. The fixed bar path of the Smith machine can make the movement more accessible for those learning the overhead press, but it still requires good shoulder mobility and core stability.
