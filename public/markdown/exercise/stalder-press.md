## Pro tips

- Develop strong pike compression flexibility before attempting this skill, as tight hamstrings will prevent the press-through.
- Keep your hips as close to your hands as possible during the compression phase to shorten the lever arm.
- Press through your shoulders actively at the top, pushing the floor away to achieve a stable Handstand finish.

- Lacking the hip flexor strength and hamstring flexibility needed, then forcing the movement with momentum.
- Placing hands too narrow, which makes the balance point harder to find during the press.
- Arching the lower back at the top instead of finishing in a straight, stacked Handstand position.
