## How to perform

1. Start in a high plank position with your hands gripping the kettlebells and your feet hip-width apart.
2. Engage your core and keep your body in a straight line from head to heels.
3. Pull one kettlebell up towards your chest, keeping your elbow close to your body.
4. Lower the kettlebell back down to the starting position and repeat with the other arm.
5. Continue alternating arms for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Place the kettlebells slightly wider than shoulder-width and turn them so the handles are parallel to your body for a stable base.
- Shift your weight slightly to the support arm before rowing, and widen your feet for better balance.
- Row the kettlebell to your hip (not your shoulder) with your elbow driving straight back to maximize lat engagement.

## Common mistakes

- Rotating the torso excessively during the row, which turns it into a twisting exercise rather than an anti-rotation one.
- Placing the feet too close together, making it nearly impossible to maintain balance during the row.
- Rushing through reps and not controlling the kettlebell back to the floor, which can destabilize the plank position.
