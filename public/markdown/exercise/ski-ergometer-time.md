## How to perform

1. Stand facing the ski ergometer and grasp the handles.
2. Start in a tall position with arms extended overhead.
3. Pull the handles down powerfully while hinging at the hips.
4. Allow your arms to swing back naturally as you complete the pull.

## Pro tips

- Initiate each pull by hinging at the hips and engaging your lats, not just yanking with your arms.
- Drive your hips back aggressively on each stroke to generate power from your posterior chain.
- Maintain a rhythmic breathing pattern: inhale as you reach up, exhale forcefully as you pull down.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling with the arms only and keeping the torso upright, which misses the primary power source (hips and lats) and causes early arm fatigue.
- Bending the knees excessively, turning the movement into a squat pattern instead of a hip hinge pull.
- Not returning to a fully extended overhead position between reps, which shortens the range of motion and reduces power output.
