## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height and position yourself on the smith machine with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Grasp the bar with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3. Lift the bar off the rack and position it at shoulder level, with your elbows bent and palms facing forward.
4. Press the bar upward until your arms are fully extended overhead.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the bar back down to shoulder level.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Stand with a slight staggered stance for balance and press the bar straight overhead.
- Brace your core hard before each rep to protect your lower back from Hyperextension.
- Lower the bar to just below chin height for a full range of motion.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning back excessively during the press, which turns it into a standing incline press and stresses the lower back.
- Pressing the bar too far forward or too far back instead of straight up over the shoulders.
- Not locking out fully at the top, which leaves the last portion of the range of motion untrained.
