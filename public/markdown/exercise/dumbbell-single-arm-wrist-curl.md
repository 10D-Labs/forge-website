## Pro tips

- Rest your forearm on your thigh with your palm facing up and only your wrist hanging off the knee for a stable setup.
- Let the dumbbell roll down to your fingertips at the bottom, then curl it back up to maximize forearm flexor range of motion.
- Use slow, deliberate reps with a 1-second squeeze at the top to build forearm strength effectively.

## Common mistakes

- Lifting the forearm off the thigh during the curl, which adds elbow flexion and reduces wrist-specific work.
- Using too heavy a weight that forces jerky, incomplete reps instead of full range of motion curls.
- Rushing through reps without pausing at the top, missing the peak contraction of the forearm flexors.
