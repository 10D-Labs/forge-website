## How to perform

1. Attach a rope to a cable machine at chest height.
2. Stand facing away from the machine with your feet shoulder-width apart.
3. Hold the rope with both hands and bring it behind your head, keeping your elbows bent.
4. Engage your abs and slowly crunch your torso forward, bringing your elbows towards your knees.
5. Pause for a moment at the top of the crunch, then slowly return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hinge at the waist and crunch your ribcage down toward your pelvis, not just bow forward with a flat back.
- Keep the rope behind your head and your hands fixed in position so the abs do all the work.
- Focus on rounding the spine (thoracic flexion) to maximally contract the rectus abdominis.

## Common mistakes

- Bending at the hips instead of flexing the spine, which turns it into a hip hinge and works the lower back.
- Pulling the rope with the arms instead of keeping the hands stationary and crunching with the torso.
- Using too much weight and relying on gravity to drop down rather than controlling the movement with the abs.
