1. Start in a pushup position with your hands placed slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
2. Engage your core and lower your body down towards the ground, keeping your elbows close to your sides.
3. As you lower yourself, lean your body forward and lift your feet off the ground, balancing on your hands.
4. Continue to lower your body until your chest is just above the ground.
5. Push through your hands and extend your arms to lift your body back up to the starting position.
6. Maintain a straight line from your head to your heels throughout the movement.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hold a solid Full Planche for at least 5 seconds before attempting the Pushup, as the bottom position is even more demanding.
- Lower slowly (3 seconds) and press up explosively to manage the extreme shoulder loading.
- Keep your body perfectly straight throughout; any hip pike means you're reducing the difficulty and not training the actual movement.

## Common mistakes

- Piking the hips at the bottom of the Pushup to make the press easier, which isn't a true Full Planche Pushup.
- Performing half reps by not lowering the chest close enough to the ground.
- Training this movement too frequently without adequate rest, leading to wrist, elbow, or shoulder overuse injuries.
