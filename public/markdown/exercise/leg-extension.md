## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height and backrest of the machine to fit your body.
2. Sit on the machine with your back against the backrest and your feet on the footpad.
3. Grasp the handles or sidebars for stability.
4. Extend your legs forward by straightening your knees, lifting the weight.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the weight back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Align the machine's pivot point with the center of your knee joint and the pad against your lower shins (just above the ankles).
- Extend your legs fully and squeeze the quads hard at the top for 1-2 seconds before lowering.
- Lower the weight slowly over 3 seconds. Don't let it slam down.

## Common mistakes

- Setting the backrest too far forward, which causes the hips to lift off the seat during the extension.
- Using momentum to swing the weight up instead of controlling the extension through the full range.
- Locking out aggressively at the top, which can hyperextend and stress the knee joint.
