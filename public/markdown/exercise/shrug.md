2. Grasp the handles with an overhand grip and keep your arms straight.

## Pro tips

- Drive your shoulders straight up toward your ears rather than rolling them forward or backward.
- Hold the top position for 2 seconds and actively squeeze the traps before lowering.
- Let your shoulders drop fully at the bottom to get a complete stretch on the traps.

- Using too much weight and barely moving the shoulders, resulting in a tiny range of motion.
- Bending the elbows or using the biceps to assist the shrug.

## FAQ

### Should I roll my shoulders when doing shrugs?

No. Straight up and down is the most effective path for trap activation. Rolling adds no extra muscle benefit and increases injury risk to the shoulder joint.

### Are machine shrugs better than Dumbbell Shrugs?

Machine shrugs provide a fixed path which can help isolate the traps, especially at heavier loads. Dumbbells allow more natural movement. Both are effective; use whichever lets you feel the traps working most.

### How heavy should I go on shrugs?

Use a weight that allows you to fully elevate your shoulders and hold the contraction. If you can't get a full range of motion or hold the top position, the weight is too heavy.

### What muscles does the Shrug work?

The Shrug primarily targets the traps, with secondary activation in the shoulders. It's classified as a strength exercise for the back.

### Is the Shrug good for beginners?

Yes, the Shrug is rated as a beginner-level exercise. It's a great starting point for building traps strength.
