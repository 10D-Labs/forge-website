## How to perform

1. Sit on the ground with your legs extended in front of you.
2. Loop the rope around the ball of your foot and hold the ends of the rope with your hands.
3. Gently pull the rope towards you, flexing your foot and stretching your calf muscles.
4. Hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds.
5. Release the tension on the rope and relax your foot.
6. Repeat the stretch on the other leg.

## Pro tips

- Pull the rope or band to evert your foot (sole turning outward) to specifically target the posterior tibialis on the inner calf.
- Maintain a straight knee and hold the position steadily for 20-30 seconds per leg.
- Apply gentle progressive tension rather than forcing the foot into an extreme position.

## Common mistakes

- Confusing eversion (targeting posterior tibialis) with dorsiflexion (targeting gastrocnemius/soleus), resulting in the wrong stretch.
- Pulling too hard and overstretching the medial ankle structures, which can cause pain.
- Not holding the stretch long enough for the deep muscle fibers to release.

### Can I stretch this muscle without a band?

Yes. Sit with your leg crossed over the opposite knee and gently press the sole of your foot outward with your hand. A band just makes it easier to maintain the position.
