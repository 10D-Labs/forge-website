## How to perform

1. Stand up straight with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing your torso.
2. Keep your elbows close to your torso and rotate the palms of your hands until they are facing forward.
3. This will be your starting position.
4. Now, keeping the upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps.
5. Continue to raise the weights until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level.
6. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
7. Then, inhale and slowly begin to lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
8. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hold the dumbbells with a neutral grip (palms facing your torso) and curl without rotating the wrists. This grip targets the brachialis and brachioradialis more than standard curls.
- Keep your elbows pinned to your sides and your upper arms motionless. Only the forearms should move.
- Lower the dumbbells for a full 2-3 seconds to maximize the eccentric contraction in the forearms and brachialis.

## Common mistakes

- Rotating the wrists during the curl to a supinated position, which turns this into a standard curl.
- Swinging the dumbbells up with body momentum, especially at the bottom of each rep.
- Not going through the full range of motion, stopping short of full extension at the bottom.
