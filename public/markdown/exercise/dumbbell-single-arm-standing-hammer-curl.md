## How to perform

1. Stand up straight with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing your torso.
2. Keep your elbows close to your torso and your upper arms stationary.
3. Exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps.
4. Continue to raise the weights until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level.
5. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
6. Inhale and slowly begin to lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep the dumbbell path straight up and down alongside your body, not curling inward across your torso.
- Maintain a firm, neutral wrist position throughout; don't let the dumbbell tilt forward or backward.
- Control the negative by lowering the dumbbell for 3 seconds to maximize brachialis time under tension.

## Common mistakes

- Crossing the dumbbell over the body toward the opposite shoulder, which changes the muscle emphasis.
- Swinging the torso to generate momentum, especially on the last few reps.
- Gripping the dumbbell too tightly, which causes forearm fatigue before the brachialis is fully worked.

## FAQ

### What's the difference between a hammer curl straight up vs. across the body?

Curling straight up targets the brachialis and brachioradialis more evenly. Curling across the body (cross-body hammer curl) shifts emphasis more to the brachialis and the long head of the biceps.

### Can I use this to build forearm size?

Yes, the neutral grip heavily recruits the brachioradialis, which is a major forearm muscle. Hammer curls are one of the best compound forearm exercises available.

### How heavy should I go for standing hammer curls?

You can typically handle 10-15% more weight on hammer curls than regular curls because the neutral grip is biomechanically stronger. Use this advantage for progressive overload.
