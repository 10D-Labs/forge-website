## How to perform

1. Lie flat on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground.
2. Place your hands behind your head with your elbows pointing outwards.
3. Engage your abs and lift your upper body off the ground, bringing your right elbow towards your left knee.
4. At the same time, extend your right leg straight out and lift it off the ground.
5. Pause for a moment, then return to the starting position.
6. Repeat the movement, this time bringing your left elbow towards your right knee and extending your left leg.

## Pro tips

- Focus on rotating your ribcage, not just moving your elbow. Your shoulder should come off the ground toward the opposite knee.
- Keep your lower back pressed into the floor throughout the movement to protect your spine.
- Extend the straight leg fully and hover it just above the ground to maximize ab and hip flexor engagement.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling on the neck with the hands to bring the elbow forward, which strains the neck and reduces ab activation.
- Moving only the elbow toward the knee without actually rotating the torso, which turns it into an arm movement instead of a core exercise.
- Letting the extended leg touch the ground between reps, which releases tension on the abs.
