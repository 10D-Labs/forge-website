## Pro tips

- Row the bar to your upper chest (collarbone level) with your elbows flared out wide to target the rear delts instead of the lats.
- Keep your torso at about a 45-degree angle and don't let your back rise up during the row.
- Use a wider-than-shoulder-width grip to emphasize the rear delts and rhomboids over the biceps and lats.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling the bar to the lower chest or stomach with elbows tucked, which turns it into a standard Bent Over Row targeting the lats.
- Using too much weight and letting the torso rise with each rep to generate momentum.
- Gripping too narrow, which shifts the emphasis to the biceps and lats instead of the rear delts.
