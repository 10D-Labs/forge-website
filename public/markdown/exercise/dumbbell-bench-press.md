## How to perform

1. Lie flat on a bench with your feet flat on the ground and your back pressed against the bench.
2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand, with your palms facing forward and your arms extended above your chest.
3. Lower the dumbbells slowly to the sides of your chest, keeping your elbows at a 90 degree angle.
4. Pause for a moment, then push the dumbbells back up to the starting position, fully extending your arms.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lower the dumbbells to the sides of your chest with your elbows at a 45-degree angle from your torso, not flared at 90 degrees. This protects the shoulders.
- At the bottom, your upper arms should be roughly parallel to the floor with a deep stretch in the chest before pressing up.
- Press the dumbbells up and slightly inward so they nearly touch at the top to achieve a stronger chest contraction.

## Common mistakes

- Flaring the elbows out at 90 degrees, which places excessive stress on the shoulder joints and rotator cuffs.
- Not retracting the shoulder blades into the bench, which reduces chest engagement and destabilizes the shoulder joint.
- Bouncing the dumbbells off the chest at the bottom rather than controlling the descent.
