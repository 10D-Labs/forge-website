## How to perform

1. Lie on a decline bench with your feet secured and your head lower than your hips.
2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing each other and your arms extended above your chest.
3. Lower the dumbbells out to the sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch in your chest.
4. Pause for a moment, then squeeze your chest muscles to bring the dumbbells back to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Set the bench to a 15-30 degree decline. With a slight bend in your elbows, lower the dumbbells in a wide arc until you feel a deep stretch in your lower chest.
- Keep the same elbow bend throughout the entire movement. Do not straighten or bend the elbows further during the arc.
- Squeeze the chest to bring the dumbbells back together above your lower chest, focusing on the pec contraction rather than pushing with the hands.

## Common mistakes

- Straightening the arms too much, which puts excessive stress on the elbow joints and bicep tendons.
- Not going deep enough to get a chest stretch, which reduces the range of motion and stimulus.
- Using too much weight, which forces you to bend the elbows excessively and turns the fly into a pressing motion.
