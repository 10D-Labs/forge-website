## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointing forward.
2. Place your hands on a wall or stable surface for balance.
3. Slowly raise your heels off the ground, lifting your body weight onto the balls of your feet.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your heels back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Perform each rep slowly with a 2-second rise, 2-second hold at the top, and 3-second lowering for maximum muscle tension.
- Do them on a step or raised surface so your heel drops below the level of your toes for a full stretch.
- For added difficulty, do single-leg raises by lifting one foot off the ground.

## Common mistakes

- Bouncing quickly through reps without controlling the movement, which uses the Achilles tendon elasticity rather than the calf muscles.
- Not rising high enough on the toes, limiting the contraction at the top.
- Leaning too far forward on the wall, which shifts weight off the calves and onto the arms.
