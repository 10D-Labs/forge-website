## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand at your sides.
2. Keeping your chest up and core engaged, slowly lower your body down by bending your knees and pushing your hips back.
3. Continue lowering until your thighs are parallel to the ground, or as low as you can comfortably go.
4. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push through your heels to return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Let the dumbbells hang naturally at your sides rather than holding them in front, which changes the loading pattern.
- Sit back into the squat as if sitting into a chair, keeping your weight in your heels and midfoot.
- Keep your chest up and eyes forward to maintain a neutral spine throughout the descent and ascent.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the knees shoot forward over the toes excessively, which shifts the load from the glutes and quads to the knees.
- Rounding the lower back at the bottom of the squat, which is dangerous under load.
- Not squatting deep enough; aim for thighs at least parallel to the floor for full muscle activation.
