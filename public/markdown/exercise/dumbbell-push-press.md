## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder level.
2. Bend your knees slightly and dip your body down, then explosively extend your legs and press the dumbbells overhead.
3. Lock out your arms at the top of the movement, then lower the dumbbells back to shoulder level.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Dip your knees 3-4 inches, then drive through your legs explosively to launch the dumbbells overhead.
- Catch the dumbbells at lockout with your biceps by your ears and your core braced tight.
- Time the leg drive so it transfers seamlessly into the press; the dip and drive should be one fluid movement.

## Common mistakes

- Dipping too deep, which wastes energy and slows the transition into the press.
- Pressing with the arms before the legs have finished driving, which loses the power transfer from the lower body.
- Not locking out fully overhead, leaving the shoulders and triceps without a stable end position.
