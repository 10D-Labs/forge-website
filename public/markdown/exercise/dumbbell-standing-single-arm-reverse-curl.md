## How to perform

2. Keep your arm fully extended and close to your body, with your palm facing down.
3. Slowly curl the dumbbell up towards your shoulder, keeping your upper arm stationary.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbell back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch to the other arm.

## Pro tips

- Hold the dumbbell with an overhand grip (palm facing down) and curl it up while keeping the upper arm stationary.
- Focus on the top portion of your forearm (brachioradialis) doing the work rather than flipping your wrist during the curl.
- Keep the wrist rigid and in line with the forearm throughout to avoid wrist strain.

## Common mistakes

- Rotating the wrist to a palms-up position during the curl, which turns this into a standard curl.
- Using body swing to get the weight up, especially since the reverse grip is mechanically weaker than a supinated grip.
- Going too heavy, leading to poor form and potential wrist strain.
