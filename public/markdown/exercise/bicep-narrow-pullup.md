## How to perform

1. Hang from a pullup bar with your palms facing towards you and your hands shoulder-width apart.
2. Engage your core and pull yourself up towards the bar, focusing on using your biceps to lift your body.
3. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower yourself back down to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use a Chinup grip (palms facing you) with hands shoulder-width apart or narrower to maximize bicep involvement.
- Pull until your chin clears the bar, focusing on squeezing the biceps at the top.
- Control the descent for 2-3 seconds to make the most of the eccentric loading on the biceps.

## Common mistakes

- Kipping or swinging to get the chin over the bar, which removes the bicep isolation element.
- Not going all the way down to a dead hang between reps, which shortens the range of motion.
- Going too narrow (hands touching) which strains the wrists without additional bicep benefit.
