## How to perform

1. Place a resistance band around your ankles.
2. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and slightly bend your knees.
3. Take a step to the side with your right foot, maintaining tension on the resistance band.
4. Follow with your left foot, stepping to the side to return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch sides.

## Pro tips

- Keep a slight bend in your knees and a low, athletic stance throughout the entire movement.
- Place the resistance band just above your ankles for maximum tension on the glute medius.
- Take deliberate, wide steps and avoid letting the trailing foot snap inward; maintain tension on the band at all times.

## Common mistakes

- Standing too upright, which reduces glute activation and shifts the work to the tensor fasciae latae.
- Letting the band go slack between steps instead of maintaining constant outward tension.
- Taking small, shuffling steps that don't create enough range of motion to effectively challenge the abductors.
