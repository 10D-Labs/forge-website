2. Engage your core and keep your back straight.
3. Press the dumbbell upwards until your arm is fully extended.

## Pro tips

- Press the dumbbell overhead with the palm facing inward (neutral grip), which is easier on the shoulder joint than a palms-forward press.
- Brace your core to resist the rotational pull of pressing with one arm and keep your torso straight.
- Press directly overhead, in line with your ear, not forward or to the side.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning away from the pressing arm, which uses lateral body momentum instead of shoulder strength.
- Rotating the palm forward during the press, losing the neutral grip advantage.
- Not bracing the core, allowing the torso to twist under the asymmetric load.
