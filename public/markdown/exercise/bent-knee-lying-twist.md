## How to perform

1. Lie flat on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground.
2. Extend your arms out to the sides, perpendicular to your body.
3. Keeping your knees together, slowly lower them to one side, aiming to touch the ground with your knees.
4. Pause for a moment, then engage your core and slowly lift your knees back to the starting position.
5. Repeat the movement to the other side.
6. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep both shoulder blades glued to the floor as you rotate your knees to each side.
- Move slowly and breathe out as your knees lower to one side to deepen the stretch.
- Only lower your knees as far as you can while keeping the opposite shoulder on the ground.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the opposite shoulder lift off the floor, which reduces the rotational stretch through the spine.
- Dropping the knees quickly to each side instead of controlling the movement throughout.
- Placing the feet too far from the body, which reduces the rotational range of motion.
