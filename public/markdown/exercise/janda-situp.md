## How to perform

1. Lie flat on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground.
2. Place your hands behind your head with your elbows pointing outwards.
3. Engaging your abs, slowly lift your upper body off the ground, curling forward until your torso is at a 45 degree angle.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your upper body back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Actively press your heels into the floor (or have a partner resist your feet) to engage your hamstrings and inhibit hip flexor involvement through reciprocal inhibition.
- Curl up vertebra by vertebra rather than hinging at the hips for true spinal flexion and maximal ab recruitment.
- Keep the movement slow and deliberate. This exercise is about quality, not reps.

## Common mistakes

- Not engaging the hamstrings by pressing the heels down, which allows the hip flexors to dominate and defeats the purpose of the Janda Situp.
- Sitting up with a flat back (hip flexion) instead of curling the spine segment by segment.
- Using too much momentum or jerking up quickly.
