## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing your torso and arms extended down.
2. Keep your back straight and your elbows close to your torso.
3. Exhale and curl the dumbbell in your right hand towards your shoulder, keeping your upper arm stationary.
4. Continue to raise the dumbbell until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbell is at shoulder level.
5. Pause for a brief moment, then inhale and slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position.
6. Repeat the movement with your left arm.
7. Continue alternating arms for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Sit with your back flat against the bench to eliminate any body swing and isolate the biceps and brachialis.
- Curl the dumbbell in a straight line up toward your shoulder, not across your body.
- Maintain the neutral grip with your thumb pointing up throughout the entire range of motion.

## Common mistakes

- Swinging the dumbbells across the body (crossbody), which changes the exercise mechanics and targets different muscles.
- Leaning back against the bench as the set gets hard to recruit the back muscles.
- Alternating too fast without pausing at the top, which reduces the peak contraction.

## FAQ

### What is the difference between a hammer curl and a regular curl?

A hammer curl uses a neutral grip (palms facing each other) which targets the brachialis and brachioradialis more. A regular curl uses a supinated grip (palms up) which targets the biceps brachii more.

### Do hammer curls make your arms bigger?

Yes, the brachialis sits underneath the biceps and pushes it up when developed, making the arm appear thicker and wider. Hammer curls are essential for overall arm size.

### Should I do seated or standing hammer curls?

Seated eliminates body swing and enforces stricter form. Standing allows more weight. Use seated for isolation and standing when you want to go heavier.
