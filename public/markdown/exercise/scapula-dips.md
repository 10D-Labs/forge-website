## How to perform

1. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and your arms extended in front of you.
2. Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight.
3. Lower your body by bending your elbows and retracting your shoulder blades, as if you are trying to squeeze a pencil between them.
4. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push through your hands to extend your elbows and return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your arms straight and locked; move only by depressing (pushing down) and elevating (shrugging up) your shoulder blades.
- At the bottom position, depress your shoulders as far as possible to maximize lower trap activation.
- Maintain an upright torso and avoid leaning forward, which would change the exercise mechanics.

## Common mistakes

- Bending the elbows and performing actual dips instead of keeping arms straight and moving only the shoulder blades.
- Not achieving full depression at the bottom, which limits the training effect on the lower traps.
- Shrugging the shoulders too aggressively at the top, which overloads the upper traps.
