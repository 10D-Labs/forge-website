## How to perform

1. Start in a high plank position with your hands directly under your shoulders and your body in a straight line from head to toe.
2. Engage your core and squeeze your glutes to maintain a stable position.
3. Lower your body down onto your forearms, one arm at a time, maintaining a straight line from head to toe.
4. Hold this position for the desired amount of time, keeping your core and glutes engaged.
5. To return to the starting position, push through your forearms and lift your body back up into a high plank position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Transition from high plank to forearm plank one arm at a time without letting your hips shift side to side.
- Keep your core braced and glutes squeezed through every transition to prevent hip sway.
- Alternate which arm leads each rep to develop equal strength on both sides.

## Common mistakes

- Rocking the hips side to side during the up-down transition, which indicates insufficient core stability.
- Always leading with the same arm, which creates an imbalance over time.
- Placing the hands or elbows too far forward instead of directly under the shoulders.
