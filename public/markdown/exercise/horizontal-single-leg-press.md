## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat of the machine so that your knees are at a 90 degree angle when your feet are on the footplate.
2. Sit on the machine with your back against the backrest and your feet shoulder-width apart on the footplate.
3. Place your hands on the handles or sides of the machine for stability.
4. Push the footplate away from your body by extending your leg, keeping your back against the backrest.
5. Pause for a moment at the fully extended position, then slowly bend your leg to return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch legs.

## Pro tips

- Press through the center of your foot, driving evenly through the heel and ball of the foot.
- Control the eccentric by lowering the weight for 2-3 seconds to increase time under tension on the working leg.
- Avoid locking out the knee at the top to keep constant tension on the muscles.

## Common mistakes

- Allowing the knee to cave inward during the press, which indicates weak glute medius and can lead to knee injury.
- Pressing with the toes, which puts excessive force on the knee joint and reduces quad and glute activation.
- Using the same weight as bilateral Leg Press, forgetting that each leg now handles the full load independently.
