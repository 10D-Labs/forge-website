- Leaning back excessively and turning the pulldown into a rowing motion, which changes the muscle recruitment pattern.
- Pulling with the biceps instead of initiating the movement by depressing and retracting the shoulder blades.
- Using too much weight and only pulling halfway down, which limits lat activation.
