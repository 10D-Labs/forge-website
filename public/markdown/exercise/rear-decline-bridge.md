4. Hold this position for a few seconds, then slowly lower your hips back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Drive through your heels, not your toes, to maximize glute activation over quad involvement.
- Squeeze your glutes hard at the top and hold for 2 seconds before lowering back down.
- Keep your chin slightly tucked to maintain a neutral spine throughout the bridge.

## Common mistakes

- Hyperextending the lower back at the top of the bridge instead of stopping when the hips are in line with the knees and shoulders.
- Pushing through the toes instead of the heels, which shifts the work to the quads and calves.
- Letting the knees cave inward during the movement, which indicates weak glute medius activation.
