2. Hold a dumbbell in one hand with an underhand grip, resting your upper arm against the preacher pad.
3. Keeping your upper arm stationary, exhale and curl the dumbbell up towards your shoulder.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then inhale and slowly lower the dumbbell back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch arms.

## Pro tips

- Press your upper arm firmly against the preacher pad and curl one dumbbell at a time for concentrated bicep work.
- Lower the dumbbell slowly to near-full extension, maintaining a slight bend to protect the tendon at the bottom.
- Squeeze the bicep hard at the top before lowering, and avoid swinging or shifting your body on the bench.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the upper arm lift off the pad to generate momentum at the sticking point.
- Hyperextending the elbow at the bottom of the rep, which puts dangerous stress on the bicep tendon.
- Using too heavy a weight and compensating with shoulder movement to complete the curl.
