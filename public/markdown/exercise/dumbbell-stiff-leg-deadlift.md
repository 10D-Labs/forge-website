## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand with an overhand grip.
2. Keeping your back straight and your core engaged, hinge at the hips and lower the dumbbells towards the ground, allowing a slight bend in your knees.
3. Lower the dumbbells until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings, then squeeze your glutes and push through your heels to return to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hinge at the hips and push your butt back while lowering the dumbbells along the front of your legs, keeping the bar path close.
- Maintain a flat back with your shoulder blades retracted throughout the entire descent and ascent.
- Lower until you feel a strong stretch in the hamstrings (usually mid-shin level), then squeeze the glutes to drive back to standing.

## Common mistakes

- Rounding the lower back during the descent, which puts the lumbar spine at risk under load.
- Bending the knees too much, which turns this into a conventional Deadlift pattern and reduces hamstring loading.
- Not hinging deep enough because of tight hamstrings, limiting the exercise's effectiveness.
