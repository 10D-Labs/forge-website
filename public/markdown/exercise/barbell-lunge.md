## How to perform

1. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and a barbell resting on your upper back.
2. Take a step forward with your right foot, keeping your torso upright.
3. Lower your body by bending your right knee until your thigh is parallel to the ground.
4. Push through your right heel to return to the starting position.
5. Repeat with your left leg, alternating legs for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Take a long enough step that your front shin stays vertical or only slightly angled forward at the bottom of the lunge.
- Keep your torso upright and avoid leaning forward; the barbell should stay directly over your hips.
- Drive back to standing through your front heel, not your toes, to maximize glute activation.

## Common mistakes

- Taking too short a step, which causes the front knee to shoot past the toes and overloads the knee joint.
- Wobbling side to side because the feet are too narrow; maintain a hip-width stance as if walking on two rails.
- Leaning forward with the torso, which places excessive stress on the lower back with the barbell loaded.

## FAQ

### Are Barbell Lunges better than Dumbbell Lunges?

Lower until your back knee is about 1-2 inches from the ground and your front thigh is parallel to the floor. Full range of motion produces the best glute and quad development.

The Barbell Lunge primarily targets the glutes, with secondary activation in the quadriceps, hamstrings, calves. It's classified as a strength exercise for the legs.
