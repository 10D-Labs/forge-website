## How to perform

1. Start in a high plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and your feet together.
2. Lower your chest towards the ground, keeping your elbows close to your body.
3. Once your chest is just above the ground, explosively push yourself up, lifting your hands off the ground.
4. As you push up, quickly move your hands out to the sides and slightly forward, allowing your body to drop down towards the ground.
5. Catch yourself with your hands in the wider position and immediately lower your chest towards the ground again.
6. Repeat the pushup motion, dropping down and catching yourself with your hands in the narrower position.
7. Continue alternating between the wider and narrower hand positions for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Start with your hands on a slightly elevated surface to give yourself more air time during the drop phase.
- Focus on catching yourself with bent elbows to absorb the impact and immediately transition into the next push.
- Keep your body rigid like a plank throughout the entire sequence to transfer force efficiently.
