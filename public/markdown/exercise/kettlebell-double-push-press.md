## How to perform

1. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a kettlebell in each hand at shoulder height.
2. Bend your knees slightly and engage your core.
3. Initiate the movement by explosively extending your hips, knees, and ankles, driving the kettlebells overhead.
4. As the kettlebells reach the top, press them fully overhead, locking out your arms.
5. Lower the kettlebells back to the starting position by bending your elbows and bringing them back down to shoulder height.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Dip your knees 4-6 inches (like a quarter squat) then explosively extend your legs to drive the kettlebells off your shoulders before finishing with arm extension.
- Keep the kettlebells in a solid rack position with elbows tight to your ribs before initiating the dip.
- Lock out aggressively overhead with your biceps by your ears and squeeze your glutes to brace the lockout.

## Common mistakes

- Dipping too deep, which turns this into a jerk or thruster pattern and wastes energy.
- Not timing the leg drive with the arm press, resulting in a sequential movement instead of an explosive coordinated push.
- Letting the kettlebells drift forward during the press instead of pressing straight up.
