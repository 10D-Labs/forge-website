## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand with an overhand grip.
2. Bend your knees and lower your hips into a squat position, keeping your back straight and chest up.
3. Explosively extend your hips and knees, driving through your heels to jump off the ground.
4. As you jump, shrug your shoulders and pull the dumbbells up towards your shoulders, keeping them close to your body.
5. Catch the dumbbells at shoulder height, with your elbows pointing forward and your palms facing up.
6. Lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position by reversing the movement.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Start in a squat position with the dumbbells on the floor. Explode upward through your hips and knees, using the lower body power to drive the dumbbells up.
- Shrug your shoulders forcefully as you jump, then quickly rotate your elbows under the dumbbells to catch them at shoulder height.
- Land softly with bent knees in a partial squat to absorb the catch. This is a power movement that requires coordination between the lower and upper body.

## Common mistakes

- Using the arms to curl the dumbbells up instead of generating force from the hip and knee extension.
- Not rotating the elbows under the dumbbells fast enough, which causes you to catch them awkwardly or drop them.
- Landing with straight legs, which sends the impact through the joints instead of absorbing it with the muscles.
