## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold the band with both hands, palms facing down.
2. Extend your arms straight out to the sides, keeping them parallel to the ground.
3. Slowly bend your elbows and bring your hands towards your shoulders, keeping your upper arms still.
4. Pause for a moment, then slowly extend your arms back out to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your upper arms parallel to the ground and only extend at the elbows to isolate the triceps.
- Fully straighten the arms at the end of each rep and squeeze the triceps for a one-second hold.
- Use a controlled tempo, especially on the return, to prevent the band from snapping your arms back.

## Common mistakes

- Dropping the elbows below shoulder height, which changes the angle and reduces tricep isolation.
- Using momentum to extend the arms instead of controlled tricep contraction.
- Not achieving full elbow extension, which limits the peak contraction of the tricep.
