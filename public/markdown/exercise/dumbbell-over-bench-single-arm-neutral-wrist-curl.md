## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with a dumbbell in one hand and your arm extended over the bench, palm facing up.
2. Keep your upper arm stationary and curl the dumbbell towards your shoulder, keeping your wrist in a neutral position.
3. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch arms.

## Pro tips

- Use a single arm to concentrate fully on the working forearm and identify any strength imbalances between sides.
- Keep the neutral grip (thumb up) consistent throughout and curl solely by flexing the wrist upward.
- Start with your weaker forearm to ensure balanced development across both sides.

## Common mistakes

- Rotating the wrist out of neutral position during the curl, which changes the targeted forearm muscles.
- Lifting the forearm off the bench surface, introducing bicep flexion into a wrist isolation exercise.
- Using too heavy a dumbbell for a single arm, which causes the wrist to jerk rather than curl smoothly.
