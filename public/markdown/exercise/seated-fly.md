## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height and position yourself on the machine with your back against the pad.
2. Grasp the handles with a pronated grip and keep your elbows slightly bent.
3. Exhale and push the handles forward, bringing them together in front of your chest.
4. Pause for a moment, squeezing your chest muscles.
5. Inhale and slowly return to the starting position, allowing your chest muscles to stretch.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep a slight bend in your elbows throughout the movement to protect the shoulder joint.
- Squeeze your chest hard at the peak contraction when the handles come together, holding for one second.
- Adjust the starting position of the arms so you feel a mild stretch in the chest without shoulder pain.

## Common mistakes

- Straightening the arms completely, which shifts stress from the chest to the elbow joint.
- Using too much weight and turning the fly into a pressing motion rather than a hugging arc.
- Allowing the shoulders to roll forward at the end of the movement instead of keeping the chest proud.
