## How to perform

1. Sit on the ground with your legs extended in front of you.
2. Bend your right knee and place your right foot on the outside of your left knee.
3. Place your left elbow on the outside of your right knee and gently twist your torso to the right.
4. Hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds, then switch sides and repeat.

## Pro tips

- Keep your spine tall and twist gently; the stretch should be felt deep in the glute of the crossed leg.
- Use your elbow against the outside of the knee as a lever to deepen the twist gradually, not forcefully.
- Breathe deeply into the stretch and increase the twist slightly on each exhale.

## Common mistakes

- Rounding the back and hunching forward, which reduces the effectiveness of the piriformis stretch.
- Forcing the twist too aggressively, which can strain the sacroiliac joint.
- Holding the stretch for too short a time. The piriformis needs at least 20-30 seconds to release effectively.
