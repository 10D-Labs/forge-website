## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height and position yourself on the machine with your back against the pad.
2. Grasp the handles with an overhand grip and fully extend your arms in front of you.
3. Keeping your upper arms stationary, slowly lower the handles towards your forehead by bending your elbows.
4. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push the handles back up to the starting position by extending your arms.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your upper arms completely stationary throughout the movement; only your forearms should move.
- Fully extend your arms at the bottom of the movement and squeeze the triceps hard for a one-count.
- Use a slow eccentric (2-3 seconds) as you bring the handles back toward your forehead.

## Common mistakes

- Flaring the elbows outward, which shifts tension away from the triceps and stresses the shoulder.
- Using momentum by swinging the upper body to push through heavy weight.
- Not achieving full lockout at the extension, which leaves the most effective portion of the range of motion untrained.
