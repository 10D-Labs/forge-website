## How to perform

1. Sit on the ground with your legs extended in front of you.
2. Bend your right knee and cross your right ankle over your left thigh.
3. Place your right hand on the ground behind you for support.
4. With your left hand, gently press down on your right knee to deepen the stretch.
5. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds to 1 minute.
6. Switch sides and repeat.

## Pro tips

- Cross your ankle above the opposite knee and gently press the raised knee downward to deepen the stretch in the glute.
- Sit tall with a straight back rather than rounding forward to get the most effective hip stretch.
- Hold for 30-60 seconds per side and breathe deeply into the stretch.

## Common mistakes

- Rounding the back excessively to try to push the knee down further, which stretches the back instead of the glute.
- Not pressing the knee down enough to feel a meaningful stretch in the hip and glute.
- Rushing through the stretch without holding long enough for the piriformis and deep hip rotators to release.
