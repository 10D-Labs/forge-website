## How to perform

1. Start by hanging from a pair of rings with your arms fully extended and your body in a straight line.
2. Spread your legs wide apart, forming a straddle position.
3. Engage your core and slowly lower your body until your arms are parallel to the ground.
4. Hold this position for a few seconds, then push yourself back up to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Build a solid iron cross hold (5+ seconds) before even attempting the maltese progression.
- Spread your legs as wide as possible to shorten the lever arm and reduce the demand on your shoulders.
- Focus on ring turned out (RTO) support holds to develop the straight-arm pressing strength this requires.

## Common mistakes

- Attempting the Straddle Maltese without years of ring training foundation, which almost guarantees injury.
- Bending the arms to compensate for insufficient straight-arm strength, turning it into a different movement entirely.
- Neglecting consistent shoulder prehab work, which leads to chronic tendonitis from the extreme joint angles.
