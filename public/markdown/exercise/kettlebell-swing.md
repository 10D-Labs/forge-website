## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointed slightly outward.
2. Hold the kettlebell with both hands in front of your body, arms extended.
3. Bend your knees slightly and hinge at the hips, pushing your butt back.
4. Swing the kettlebell back between your legs, keeping your arms straight and maintaining a flat back.
5. Drive your hips forward and swing the kettlebell up to shoulder height, using the momentum generated by your hips.
6. Allow the kettlebell to swing back down between your legs and repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- This is a hip hinge, not a squat. Your knees should bend slightly, but the power comes from snapping the hips forward.
- At the top of the swing, squeeze your glutes hard and brace your abs as if you're about to be punched. The bell should float to shoulder height.
- Let the Kettlebell Swing back between your legs on each rep by hinging your hips back. Your forearms should contact your inner thighs.

## Common mistakes

- Squatting the swing by bending the knees too much instead of hinging at the hips.
- Using the arms to lift the kettlebell rather than projecting it forward with hip power.
- Hyperextending the lower back at the top instead of finishing in a tall, braced standing position.
