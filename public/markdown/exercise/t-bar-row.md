4. Keep your back straight and engage your core.
5. Pull the handles towards your torso, squeezing your shoulder blades together.
6. Pause for a moment at the peak contraction, then slowly release the handles back to the starting position.

## Common mistakes

- Rounding the upper back and letting the shoulders roll forward instead of maintaining a proud chest.
- Using too much weight and shortening the range of motion, barely pulling the handles back.
- Jerking the weight up with momentum instead of pulling smoothly with the back muscles.
