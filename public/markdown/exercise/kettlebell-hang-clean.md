## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a kettlebell in front of your thighs.
2. Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight.
3. Lower the kettlebell towards the ground, allowing it to swing between your legs.
4. Quickly extend your hips and knees, using the momentum to swing the kettlebell up to shoulder height.
5. As the kettlebell reaches shoulder height, rotate your wrists and catch the kettlebell in the rack position, with your elbow tucked in and the kettlebell resting on your forearm.
6. Lower the kettlebell back down to the starting position between your legs, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hinge at the hips and let the Kettlebell Swing back between your legs before explosively snapping your hips forward to propel it to the rack position.
- Tame the arc by keeping the kettlebell close to your body. Think of zipping up a jacket rather than swinging in a wide loop.
- Catch the kettlebell softly in the rack position by meeting it with your hand and absorbing the momentum with a slight knee dip.

## Common mistakes

- Using the arm to pull the kettlebell up instead of driving with the hips, which fatigues the biceps and misses the point of the exercise.
- Letting the kettlebell bang against the forearm at the catch because the wrist isn't rotating smoothly.
- Not hinging deeply enough, which reduces the power of the hip snap.
