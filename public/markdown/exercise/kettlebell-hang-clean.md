## How to Perform Kettlebell Hang Clean

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a kettlebell in front of your thighs.
2. Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight.
3. Lower the kettlebell towards the ground, allowing it to swing between your legs.
4. Quickly extend your hips and knees, using the momentum to swing the kettlebell up to shoulder height.
5. As the kettlebell reaches shoulder height, rotate your wrists and catch the kettlebell in the rack position, with your elbow tucked in and the kettlebell resting on your forearm.
6. Lower the kettlebell back down to the starting position between your legs, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
