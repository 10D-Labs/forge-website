## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet hip-width apart and hands on your hips.
2. Take a big step forward with your right foot, lowering your body into a lunge position.
3. Bend your right knee to about 90 degrees, keeping your knee aligned with your ankle.
4. Push off with your right foot and return to the starting position.
5. Repeat with your left leg, alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Step far enough forward that both knees form roughly 90-degree angles at the bottom of the lunge.
- Keep your front knee tracking over your second and third toes; don't let it cave inward.
- Push back to the starting position through your front heel, not the ball of your foot.

## Common mistakes

- Taking too short a step forward, which puts excessive stress on the front knee.
- Leaning the torso forward over the front leg instead of keeping the chest upright.
- Letting the back knee slam into the ground instead of lowering it with control.
