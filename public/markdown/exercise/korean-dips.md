2. Lower your body by bending your elbows until your upper arms are parallel to the ground.
3. Pause for a moment, then push yourself back up to the starting position by straightening your arms.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Position the bars behind your body so your hands are at hip level, which shifts the load onto your chest and front delts.
- Lean your torso forward as you descend to increase the stretch on your chest muscles.
- Start with partial range of motion and gradually increase depth as your shoulder mobility improves.

- Keeping the torso completely upright, which turns it into a standard dip and misses the unique chest stretch.
- Flaring the elbows out wide instead of keeping them at roughly 45 degrees from the body.
