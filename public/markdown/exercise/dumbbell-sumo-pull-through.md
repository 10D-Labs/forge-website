## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, toes pointed outwards.
2. Hold a dumbbell with both hands in front of your body, arms extended.
3. Bend your knees and lower your hips down into a squat position, keeping your back straight.
4. Lower the dumbbell down between your legs, keeping your arms straight.
5. Drive through your heels and extend your hips forward, pulling the dumbbell up and in front of your body.
6. Squeeze your glutes at the top of the movement, then lower the dumbbell back down between your legs.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Drive your hips forward explosively at the top to squeeze the glutes, like a Kettlebell Swing but with a dumbbell.
- Keep the dumbbell close to your body as it swings between your legs to maintain control.
- Use a wide sumo stance with toes pointed out to allow the dumbbell to pass between your legs comfortably.

## Common mistakes

- Squatting down instead of hinging at the hips, which shifts the exercise from a glute/hamstring movement to a quad-dominant one.
- Rounding the back during the lowering phase, which puts the lumbar spine at risk.
- Using the arms to lift the dumbbell instead of driving through the hips; the arms should only act as connectors.
