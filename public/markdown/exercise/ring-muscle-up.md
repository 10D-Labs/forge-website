## How to Perform Ring Muscle Up

1. Hang from gymnast rings with arms fully extended, using a false grip (wrists over the rings).
2. Engage your core and pull yourself up explosively, bringing your chest toward the rings.
3. As you reach the top of the pull, lean forward and transition your hands from below to above the rings.
4. Press yourself up by straightening your arms until you're in the support position above the rings.
5. Lower yourself back down with control, reversing the movement.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
