## How to perform

1. Hang from gymnast rings with arms fully extended, using a false grip (wrists over the rings).
2. Engage your core and pull yourself up explosively, bringing your chest toward the rings.
3. As you reach the top of the pull, lean forward and transition your hands from below to above the rings.
4. Press yourself up by straightening your arms until you're in the support position above the rings.
5. Lower yourself back down with control, reversing the movement.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Master the false grip (wrists curled over the top of the rings) before attempting the Muscle Up; it's essential for the transition.
- Pull aggressively and then lean your chest forward over the rings during the transition phase.
- Keep the rings close to your body throughout the entire movement; wide rings make the transition nearly impossible.

## Common mistakes

- Attempting the Muscle Up without a strong false grip, which causes the hands to slip during the transition.
- Not pulling high enough before transitioning, resulting in a failed catch or excessive kipping.
- Neglecting the dip portion of the movement and collapsing at the top instead of pressing out to full lockout.
