## How to perform

1. Find an open space with enough room to perform a handstand.
2. Place your hands on the ground shoulder-width apart, fingers pointing forward.
3. Kick your legs up towards the wall, using your core and shoulders to maintain balance.
4. Once in a handstand position, engage your triceps to support your body weight.
5. Hold the handstand for as long as you can maintain balance.
6. To come down, slowly lower your legs back to the ground.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Focus on pressing through your fingertips to make micro-balance adjustments rather than trying to hold a rigid position.
- Stack your joints: wrists under shoulders, shoulders over hips, hips over ankles, creating one straight line.
- Practice facing the wall (stomach toward wall) to build the correct body alignment before attempting freestanding holds.

## Common mistakes

- Arching the lower back (banana shape) instead of tucking the ribs and squeezing the glutes for a straight line.
- Looking at the ground directly below instead of slightly forward between your hands, which throws off alignment.
- Kicking up with too much force and consistently overshooting, rather than developing a controlled kick-up.
