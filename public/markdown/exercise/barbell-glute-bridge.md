## How to perform

1. Start by lying flat on your back on the ground with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor.
2. Place a barbell across your hips, holding it securely with both hands.
3. Engage your glutes and core muscles, then lift your hips off the ground until your body forms a straight line from your knees to your shoulders.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, squeezing your glutes.
5. Slowly lower your hips back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use a thick bar pad or folded towel across your hips to prevent the barbell from digging into your hip bones.
- Set up with your shoulder blades against the ground and your feet about hip-width apart, heels roughly 12 inches from your glutes.
- Drive through your heels and squeeze your glutes at the top until your body forms a straight line from knees to shoulders.

## Common mistakes

- Pushing through the toes instead of the heels, which shifts work from the glutes to the quads.
- Hyperextending the lower back at the top by pushing the hips too high, which compresses the lumbar spine.
- Placing the feet too far from the glutes, which turns it into a hamstring-dominant exercise.
