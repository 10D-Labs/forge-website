## How to perform

1. Stand up straight with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing down and arms fully extended.
2. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps.
3. Continue to raise the dumbbells until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level.
4. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
5. Inhale and slowly begin to lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your wrists straight and firm throughout; the overhand grip means your forearm extensors work hard to stabilize.
- Use a lighter weight than regular curls since the overhand grip is mechanically disadvantaged.
- Curl in a slow, controlled arc and avoid swinging the dumbbells up with body momentum.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the wrists flex or droop under the weight, which reduces brachioradialis activation and strains the wrist.
- Using the same weight as regular curls, leading to poor form and excessive cheating.
- Swinging the body to generate momentum, which is tempting because the overhand grip is weaker.
