2. Rest your forearm on your thigh, allowing your wrist to hang off the edge.
3. Keeping your forearm stationary, curl your wrist upward as far as possible.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your wrist back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch to the other hand.

## Pro tips

- Rest your forearm on your thigh with a neutral grip (thumb up) and curl the wrist upward in a hammer-like motion.
- Only your wrist should move, keeping the forearm completely stationary on the thigh.
- Use a light weight and high reps (15-25) since the forearm muscles involved are small and prone to overuse injury.

## Common mistakes

- Moving the entire forearm instead of isolating the wrist curl movement.
- Using too heavy a weight, which forces compensatory movement from the elbow.
- Positioning the wrist too far back on the thigh, which reduces the effective range of motion.
