2. Extend your arms straight out to the sides at shoulder height, palms facing down.
3. Keeping your arms straight, slowly rotate your arms in a circular motion, bringing the dumbbells in front of your body and then overhead.
4. Continue the circular motion, bringing the dumbbells back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use light weight and focus on controlling the full circular arc; this exercise is about shoulder mobility and endurance, not max load.
- Keep a slight bend in your elbows throughout the entire rotation to protect the elbow joints.
- Move slowly through the overhead portion of the circle where your shoulders are most vulnerable.

## Common mistakes

- Using too heavy a weight, which causes compensatory movements like arching the back or shrugging the shoulders.
- Rushing through the overhead portion of the circle, which is where most shoulder injuries occur during this movement.
- Locking the elbows completely straight, which puts unnecessary stress on the elbow joint under load.
