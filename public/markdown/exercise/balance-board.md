## How to perform

1. Place the balance board on a flat surface.
2. Step onto the balance board with one foot, ensuring it is centered.
3. Slowly shift your weight onto the foot on the balance board, keeping your core engaged.
4. Maintain your balance and stability as you hold the position for a desired amount of time.
5. Repeat the exercise with the other foot.

## Pro tips

- Start near a wall or rack you can grab if needed, and focus on keeping your gaze on a fixed point ahead to improve stability.
- Engage your core and keep a slight bend in your knees rather than locking them out, which helps you react to the board's movement.
- Once you can balance on two feet for 60 seconds, progress to single-leg stance to increase the challenge.

## Common mistakes

- Looking down at the board instead of straight ahead, which actually makes balancing harder.
- Locking the knees and keeping the legs stiff, reducing your ability to make quick micro-adjustments.
- Starting on a surface that's too slippery, causing the board to slide out from under you.
