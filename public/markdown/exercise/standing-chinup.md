## How to perform

1. Adjust the machine to your desired assistance level.
2. Stand on the foot platform and grip the handles with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3. Keep your chest up and shoulders back, engage your core, and slightly bend your knees.
4. Pull your body up by flexing your elbows and driving your elbows down towards your sides.
5. Continue pulling until your chin is above the bar.
6. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your body back down to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Adjust the assistance to a level where you can complete 8-12 reps with good form but the last 2-3 reps are challenging.
- Use a supinated (palms toward you) grip and pull your elbows down toward your ribs to maximize lat and biceps engagement.
- Control the lowering phase for 2-3 seconds rather than just dropping back to the start position.

## Common mistakes

- Setting the assistance too high, making the exercise too easy to stimulate muscle growth.
- Leaning back excessively instead of pulling vertically, which turns it into a row-like movement.
- Not going through a full range of motion by stopping short of getting the chin above the handles.
