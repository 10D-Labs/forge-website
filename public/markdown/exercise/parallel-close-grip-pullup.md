## How to perform

1. Adjust the machine to your desired weight and height.
2. Place your hands on the parallel bars with a close grip, palms facing each other.
3. Hang from the bars with your arms fully extended and your feet off the ground.
4. Engage your back muscles and pull your body up towards the bars, keeping your elbows close to your body.
5. Continue pulling until your chin is above the bars.
6. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your body back down to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use a neutral (palms facing each other) grip to reduce wrist and shoulder strain while maximizing bicep and lat engagement.
- Pull your elbows down toward your hips rather than thinking about pulling yourself up; this cue activates the lats more effectively.
- Control the descent for at least 2-3 seconds to build strength through the full range of motion.

## Common mistakes

- Kipping or swinging the body to get the chin over the bar, which removes the muscle-building stimulus.
- Only pulling halfway up instead of getting the chin clearly above the handles.
- Letting the body drop quickly on the way down instead of controlling the eccentric phase.
