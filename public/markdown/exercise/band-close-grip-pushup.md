4. Push through your palms to extend your arms and return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Place your hands directly under your shoulders or even closer together to maximize tricep activation.
- Keep the band taut across your upper back to add resistance at the top of the Pushup where you are strongest.
- Lower your chest all the way to the floor and press up explosively against the band resistance.

- Letting the band slip off the upper back mid-set, which removes the added resistance.
- Flaring the elbows out wide, which shifts the emphasis from triceps to chest.
- Sagging the hips, which reduces core engagement and puts stress on the lower back.
