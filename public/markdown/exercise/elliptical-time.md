## How to perform

2. Step onto the pedals of the machine and grip the handles lightly.

5. Maintain a steady pace and keep your core engaged throughout the exercise.
6. Continue for your target duration.

- Push through your heels rather than your toes to engage more glute and hamstring activation.
- Vary the incline and resistance throughout your session to prevent adaptation and increase calorie burn.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning heavily on the handrails, which reduces the workload on your legs and core and inflates your perceived effort.
- Setting the resistance too low and pedaling very fast, which provides minimal muscle engagement and reduces training benefit.
- Maintaining the same speed and resistance for the entire session, which leads to diminished returns over time.
