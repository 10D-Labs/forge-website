## How to perform

1. Lie down on a decline bench with your head lower than your hips.
2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing each other and your arms extended straight up over your chest.
3. Lower the dumbbells out to the sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch in your chest.
4. As you lower the dumbbells, twist your wrists so that your palms face forward at the bottom of the movement.
5. Reverse the motion and bring the dumbbells back up to the starting position, squeezing your chest muscles at the top.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Start with palms facing each other at the top, then rotate your wrists so palms face forward as you lower the dumbbells in the fly arc. This twist adds a rotational component to the chest stretch.
- The wrist rotation should be gradual throughout the lowering phase, not sudden. Reverse the rotation smoothly as you bring the dumbbells back up.
- Use lighter weight than standard decline flyes since the rotational component adds instability.

## Common mistakes

- Twisting the wrists too aggressively or suddenly, which can strain the wrist and forearm.
- Using the same weight as standard flyes, which makes the twist component uncontrollable.
- Forgetting to reverse the twist on the way up, which loses the rotational benefit.
