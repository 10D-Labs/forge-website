## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with your legs spread apart and your feet flat on the ground.
2. Hold a dumbbell in one hand and place your elbow on the inside of your thigh, just above the knee.
3. With your palm facing up, curl the dumbbell towards your shoulder while keeping your upper arm stationary.
4. Squeeze your biceps at the top of the movement, then slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch arms.

## Pro tips

- Press your elbow firmly into the inside of your thigh to create a stable pivot point that prevents cheating.
- Curl the dumbbell slowly toward your shoulder, focusing on squeezing the bicep at the peak.
- Lower under control for a 3-second eccentric; don't let gravity drop the weight.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the elbow slide off the thigh during the curl, which allows the shoulder to assist the movement.
- Leaning the torso toward the curling arm to shorten the range of motion and make it easier.
- Using too much weight, which forces you to use momentum instead of strict bicep contraction.
