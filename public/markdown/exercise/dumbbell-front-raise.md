## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing your thighs.
2. Keeping your arms straight, exhale and lift the dumbbells in front of you until they are at shoulder level.
3. Pause for a moment at the top, then inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hold dumbbells in front of your thighs with palms facing your body. Raise them straight in front of you to shoulder height, keeping your arms nearly straight.
- Use a thumbs-up grip (palms facing each other) to reduce shoulder impingement risk while still effectively targeting the anterior deltoid.
- Stop at shoulder height. Going higher recruits the upper traps and does not add to front delt stimulation.

## Common mistakes

- Swinging the torso backward to lift heavier dumbbells, which uses momentum and can strain the lower back.
- Raising the dumbbells too high above shoulder level, which shifts tension to the traps.
- Using pronated grip (palms down) with heavy weight, which can irritate the shoulder joint in the overhead position.
