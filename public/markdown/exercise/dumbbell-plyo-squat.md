## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand at your sides.
2. Lower your body into a squat position by bending your knees and pushing your hips back.
3. As you reach the bottom of the squat, explode upward, jumping off the ground.
4. While in the air, quickly switch the position of your feet, landing with your opposite foot forward.
5. Immediately lower your body back into a squat position and repeat the jump, switching your feet again.
6. Continue alternating the position of your feet with each jump for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Land softly with bent knees to absorb the impact, never landing with locked-out legs.
- Use lighter dumbbells than your regular squat weight since the explosive jump demands more from your joints and stabilizers.
- Explode upward from the bottom of the squat as fast as possible, driving through the balls of your feet.

## Common mistakes

- Landing with stiff, straight legs, which sends shock through the knees, hips, and spine.
- Using too heavy of dumbbells, which slows the jump and increases injury risk on landing.
- Letting the knees cave inward on the landing, which can strain the knee ligaments under the impact forces.
