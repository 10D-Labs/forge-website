## How to perform

1. Set up an incline bench at a 45 degree angle.
2. Lie down on the bench with your feet flat on the ground.
3. Grasp the barbell with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
4. Unrack the barbell and lower it slowly towards your chest, keeping your elbows at a 45 degree angle.
5. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push the barbell back up to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Set the bench to 30-45 degrees; steeper angles turn it into more of a shoulder press than a chest exercise.
- Lower the bar to your upper chest (clavicle area), not the same spot as flat bench.
- Keep your shoulder blades retracted and pinched together to protect the shoulder joint and create a stable pressing surface.

## Common mistakes

- Setting the incline too steep (60+ degrees), which makes the front delts the primary mover instead of the upper chest.
- Lowering the bar too low on the chest, which strains the shoulder at the bottom position.
- Losing the shoulder blade retraction during the press, which destabilizes the shoulders and limits power.
