## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand with an overhand grip.
2. Let the dumbbells hang in front of your thighs, with your arms fully extended.
3. Keeping your back straight and your core engaged, exhale and lift the dumbbells straight up towards your chin, leading with your elbows.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lead with your elbows and keep the dumbbells close to your body throughout the pull to maximize shoulder and trap activation.
- Stop pulling when your elbows reach shoulder height; going higher adds shoulder impingement risk without meaningful extra muscle activation.
- Use a slightly wider grip to reduce internal rotation stress on the shoulder joint.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling the dumbbells too high above shoulder level, which can cause shoulder impingement, especially in people with limited mobility.
- Using momentum by swinging the torso or shrugging the traps excessively instead of controlling the lift with the deltoids.
- Gripping the dumbbells too tightly, which shifts tension to the forearms and away from the shoulders.
