## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand.
2. Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight.
3. Extend your arms straight down towards the ground, palms facing each other.
4. Keeping a slight bend in your elbows, lift your arms out to the sides and squeeze your shoulder blades together.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your arms back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hinge at the hips until your torso is nearly parallel to the floor, then raise the dumbbells out to the sides with a slight elbow bend.
- Think about pushing the dumbbells away from each other rather than lifting them, which helps cue the rear delts.
- Keep your chin tucked and neck neutral to avoid straining the neck during the bent-over position.

## Common mistakes

- Not hinging forward enough, which turns this into a Lateral Raise and misses the rear delts entirely.
- Bending the elbows too much during the lift, turning the fly into a row that recruits the lats and biceps.
- Rounding the lower back under fatigue, which puts the spine at risk during the bent-over position.
