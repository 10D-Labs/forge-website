## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and toes pointing slightly outward.
2. Hold the barbell across your upper back, resting it on your traps or rear delts.
3. Engage your core and keep your chest up as you slowly lower your body by bending your knees and pushing your hips back.
4. Continue lowering until your thighs are parallel to the ground or slightly below.
5. Pause for a moment, then push through your heels to return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Position your feet hip-width apart or slightly narrower with toes pointing forward or very slightly out.
- The narrow stance shifts more emphasis to the quads compared to a wide stance; expect to feel it more in the front of your thighs.
- You may need to elevate your heels on small plates if ankle mobility limits your depth with a narrow stance.

## Common mistakes

- Going so narrow that the knees cave inward, which stresses the knee ligaments.
- Leaning too far forward to compensate for limited ankle mobility in the narrow stance.
- Not going deep enough; the narrow stance can feel restrictive at the bottom, so work on ankle mobility.

## FAQ

### What's the difference between narrow and regular stance squats?

Narrow stance places more emphasis on the quadriceps and requires more ankle mobility. Regular (shoulder-width) stance distributes the load more evenly between quads, glutes, and hamstrings.

### Will narrow stance squats build bigger quads?

Yes, the narrow stance increases knee flexion demands, which means the quads must work harder. They're an excellent variation for quad-dominant leg development.

### Should I use heeled squat shoes for narrow stance squats?

Squat shoes with a raised heel are very helpful for narrow stance squats because they compensate for limited ankle dorsiflexion. If you don't have squat shoes, placing small plates under your heels works as well.

### What muscles does the Barbell Narrow Stance Squat work?

The Barbell Narrow Stance Squat primarily targets the glutes, with secondary activation in the quadriceps, hamstrings, calves. It's classified as a strength exercise for the legs.

### Is the Barbell Narrow Stance Squat good for beginners?

The Barbell Narrow Stance Squat is rated as intermediate. Beginners should build a base of glutes strength with easier variations first.
