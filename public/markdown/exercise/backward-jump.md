## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Bend your knees slightly and jump backwards, pushing off with both feet.
3. Land softly on the balls of your feet, bending your knees to absorb the impact.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Look straight ahead, not behind you, and use spatial awareness to jump in a controlled distance.
- Bend your knees and load your calves and quads before exploding backward; don't just fall back.
- Land on the balls of your feet first, then let your heels touch down as you absorb the impact through bent knees.

## Common mistakes

- Turning your head to look behind you, which throws off balance and can strain the neck.
- Jumping too far back before mastering a short, controlled hop, increasing the risk of tripping.
- Landing flat-footed, which sends impact straight through the knees and spine.
