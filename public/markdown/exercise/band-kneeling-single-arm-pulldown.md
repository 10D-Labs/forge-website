1. Attach the band to a sturdy anchor point above your head.
2. Kneel down and hold the band with one hand, palm facing down.
3. Extend your arm fully overhead, keeping your elbow slightly bent.
4. Engage your lat muscles and pull the band down towards your side, bringing your elbow towards your ribcage.
5. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then slowly release the tension and return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch sides.

## Pro tips

- Kneel on one or both knees and pull the band from overhead down to your side, driving the elbow toward your hip.
- Initiate the pull by depressing the shoulder blade on the working side before bending the elbow.
- Squeeze the lat at the bottom for a one-second hold before releasing the band back up.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling with the bicep instead of starting the movement with the lat by depressing the shoulder blade.
- Leaning away from the anchor point, which turns it into a row instead of a pulldown.
- Using too thick a band, which causes form breakdown and reduces mind-muscle connection with the lat.
