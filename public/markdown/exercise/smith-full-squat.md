## How to perform

1. Set up the smith machine with the barbell at shoulder height.
2. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly turned out.
3. Step under the bar and position it across your upper back, resting on your traps.
4. Grip the bar with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
5. Unrack the bar and take a step back, maintaining a stable stance.
6. Keeping your chest up and core engaged, initiate the squat by pushing your hips back and bending your knees.
7. Lower your body until your thighs are parallel to the ground, or as low as your flexibility allows.
8. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then drive through your heels to return to the starting position.
9. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Position your feet slightly in front of the bar path so you can sit deeper without your knees tracking too far forward.
- Keep your chest proud and elbows pulled down to prevent rounding at the bottom of the squat.
- Use a controlled two-second descent to build strength through the full range of motion.

## Common mistakes

- Standing directly under the bar as you would with a free barbell, which limits squat depth on the Smith machine.
- Relying on the fixed bar path and neglecting core bracing, which builds bad habits for free weight squatting.
- Bouncing out of the bottom position instead of pausing briefly to build strength at end range.
