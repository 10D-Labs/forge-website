## How to perform

1. Lie flat on a bench with your feet flat on the ground and your back pressed against the bench.
2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with a neutral grip (palms facing each other) and your arms extended straight up over your chest.
3. Slowly lower the dumbbells down towards your chest, keeping your elbows close to your body.
4. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push the dumbbells back up to the starting position, fully extending your arms.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your elbows tucked close to your sides at a 30-45 degree angle to maximize triceps involvement with the neutral grip.
- Lower the dumbbells to the lower chest or nipple line for optimal pressing mechanics with the palms-in position.
- Drive the dumbbells straight up, keeping the palms facing each other throughout, and squeeze the triceps at lockout.

## Common mistakes

- Flaring the elbows out wide, which shifts the exercise from a triceps-dominant press to a standard Chest Press.
- Lowering the dumbbells to the upper chest or neck, which puts the shoulders in a vulnerable position.
- Rotating the wrists to face forward during the press, losing the neutral grip triceps benefit.
