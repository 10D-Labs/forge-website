## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a barbell in front of your chest with both hands, palms facing down.
2. Engage your core and keep your back straight throughout the exercise.
3. Slowly twist your torso to the right, pivoting on your feet and hips, while keeping your lower body stable.
4. Pause for a moment at the end of the twist, then slowly return to the starting position.
5. Repeat the twist to the left side.
6. Continue alternating twists for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hold the bar across your upper back and rotate your torso from side to side using your obliques, not momentum.
- Keep your hips facing forward and only rotate from the mid-back (thoracic spine).
- Move slowly and controlled; fast twisting with a bar on your back can strain the lower back.

## Common mistakes

- Rotating the hips along with the torso, which takes work away from the obliques and can stress the knees.
- Twisting too fast and using centrifugal force rather than muscular control.
- Using a heavy barbell when bodyweight rotation would provide adequate resistance for the obliques.

Yes, if done aggressively. The lumbar spine isn't designed for rotation under load. Rotate slowly from the mid-back, keep the range of motion moderate, and use light weight.

### How many reps should I do per side?

15-20 rotations per side with slow, controlled tempo. This is an endurance and mobility exercise, not a strength exercise.
