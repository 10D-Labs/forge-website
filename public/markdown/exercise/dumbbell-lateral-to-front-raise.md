2. Keep your back straight and engage your core.
3. Raise your arms out to the sides until they are parallel to the ground, keeping a slight bend in your elbows.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your arms back down to the starting position.
5. Next, raise your arms in front of you until they are parallel to the ground, again keeping a slight bend in your elbows.
6. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your arms back down to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Perform the Lateral Raise first, return to start, then the front raise as one complete rep to ensure each portion gets full attention.
- Use the same controlled tempo for both the lateral and front portions so one direction does not compensate for the other.
- Keep the weight light since this is a compound set hitting multiple delt heads in a single rep, which fatigues fast.

## Common mistakes

- Rushing through the lateral portion to get to the front raise, which reduces lateral delt activation.
- Using too heavy a weight, leading to momentum-based swinging in both directions rather than controlled raises.
- Blending the two movements into a diagonal raise instead of performing distinct lateral and front raise patterns.
