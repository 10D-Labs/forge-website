## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet hip-width apart, holding a barbell in front of your thighs with an overhand grip.
2. Shift your weight onto your left foot and lift your right foot slightly off the ground.
3. Hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight and your right leg extended behind you for balance.
4. Lower the barbell towards the ground, keeping it close to your body and your left leg slightly bent.
5. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then engage your glutes and hamstrings to lift your torso back up to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch sides.

## Pro tips

- Hold the barbell with an overhand grip and shift your weight to one leg before hinging forward.
- Extend the non-working leg straight behind you as a counterbalance, keeping your hips square to the floor.
- Keep the barbell close to your standing leg throughout the movement, almost touching it.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the hip of the elevated leg rotate open, which twists the pelvis and reduces hamstring and glute engagement.
- Rounding the back as you hinge forward, especially as the barbell gets heavier.
- Not extending the back leg fully, which reduces the counterbalance and makes the movement less stable.
