## How to perform

1. Lie on a decline bench with your feet secured and your head lower than your hips.
2. Grasp the barbell with an overhand grip slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3. Unrack the barbell and lower it slowly towards your chest, keeping your elbows tucked in.
4. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push the barbell back up to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Set the decline angle to 15-30 degrees; steeper angles don't provide additional lower chest benefit and make unracking harder.
- Keep your shoulder blades pinched together and drive the bar in a slight arc from your lower chest to over your shoulders.
- Hook your feet securely under the leg pads before unracking to prevent sliding down the bench.

## Common mistakes

- Using too steep a decline angle, which reduces the range of motion and increases blood pressure in the head.
- Bouncing the bar off the chest, which is especially dangerous on a decline because the bar path is angled toward your face.
- Neglecting to secure the feet properly, creating instability that limits how much weight you can safely press.

## FAQ

### Does decline bench press actually target the lower chest?

Yes. EMG studies show decline press activates the lower (sternal) portion of the pectorals more than flat bench. However, flat bench still works the lower chest significantly.

Not necessarily. Dips with a forward lean target the lower chest similarly to decline press. If you already do weighted dips, decline bench is optional.

### Why do I feel stronger on decline bench than flat bench?

The decline angle shortens the range of motion and puts the chest fibers in a mechanically advantageous position. Most people can decline press 10-15% more than their flat bench.

The Barbell Decline Bench Press primarily targets the chest, with secondary activation in the triceps, shoulders. It's classified as a strength exercise for the chest.
