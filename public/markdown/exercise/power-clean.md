## How to Perform Power Clean

1. Start with the barbell on the ground in front of you, with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Bend down and grip the barbell with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3. Keep your back straight and chest up as you lift the barbell off the ground, extending your hips and knees.
4. As the barbell reaches your mid-thigh, explosively pull it upwards, shrugging your shoulders and pulling your elbows high and to the sides.
5. As the barbell reaches its highest point, quickly drop underneath it, rotating your elbows around and catching the barbell on your shoulders in a front squat position.
6. Stand up with the barbell, fully extending your hips and knees.
7. Lower the barbell back down to the starting position, keeping control of the weight throughout the movement.
8. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
