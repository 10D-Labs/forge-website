## How to perform

1. Start with the barbell on the ground in front of you, with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Bend down and grip the barbell with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3. Keep your back straight and chest up as you lift the barbell off the ground, extending your hips and knees.
4. As the barbell reaches your mid-thigh, explosively pull it upwards, shrugging your shoulders and pulling your elbows high and to the sides.
5. As the barbell reaches its highest point, quickly drop underneath it, rotating your elbows around and catching the barbell on your shoulders in a front squat position.
6. Stand up with the barbell, fully extending your hips and knees.
7. Lower the barbell back down to the starting position, keeping control of the weight throughout the movement.
8. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep the bar close to your body throughout the entire pull; it should almost brush your thighs on the way up.
- The power comes from the hip extension (the 'second pull'), not from pulling with your arms. Think of your arms as hooks.
- Receive the bar in a quarter squat position with elbows high and the bar resting on your front delts, not in your hands.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling with the arms too early instead of driving through the hips first, which kills power production.
- Letting the bar swing away from the body during the pull, which makes the catch position difficult and dangerous.
- Not receiving the bar properly in the front rack position, catching it with the wrists bent back instead of elbows high.
