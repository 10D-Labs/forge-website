## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your toes pointing forward.
2. Hold the barbell with an overhand grip, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3. Bend at the hips, keeping your back straight and your knees slightly bent.
4. Lower the barbell towards the ground, keeping it close to your body.
5. Feel the stretch in your hamstrings as you lower the barbell.
6. Once you feel a stretch in your hamstrings, push your hips forward and stand up straight.
7. Squeeze your glutes at the top of the movement.
8. Lower the barbell back down to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Push your hips back like you're closing a car door with your backside; the bar should slide down your thighs, never drifting away from your body.
- Lower until you feel a deep Hamstring Stretch (usually around mid-shin), then reverse by driving the hips forward.
- Keep a slight bend in the knees throughout, and don't increase or decrease the knee angle during the movement.

## Common mistakes

- Rounding the lower back as the bar descends, which is the most common and most dangerous mistake.
- Bending the knees too much, which turns it into a conventional Deadlift and reduces the Hamstring Stretch.
- Not pushing the hips back far enough, limiting the range of motion and reducing hamstring activation.

## FAQ

### What's the difference between a Romanian Deadlift and a conventional Deadlift?

The RDL starts from the top (standing), uses a slight knee bend, and emphasizes the hip hinge to stretch the hamstrings. The conventional Deadlift starts from the floor with more knee bend and is a more quad-involved movement.

### How low should I go on Romanian Deadlifts?

Until you feel a strong stretch in your hamstrings, which is typically mid-shin to just below the knee for most people. Going lower at the expense of a flat back defeats the purpose.

### Can I do Romanian Deadlifts with dumbbells instead?

Yes. Dumbbells work well and allow your arms to hang naturally at your sides. However, a barbell allows heavier loading and a more standardized movement path.

The Barbell Romanian Deadlift primarily targets the glutes, with secondary activation in the hamstrings, lower back. It's classified as a strength exercise for the legs.
