## How to perform

1. Sit on the cable machine with your feet flat on the floor and your knees slightly bent.
2. Grasp the V bar attachment with an overhand grip, palms facing each other, and your hands shoulder-width apart.
3. Keep your back straight and lean slightly forward from the hips.
4. Pull the V bar towards your torso by retracting your shoulder blades and squeezing your back muscles.
5. Pause for a moment at the peak of the contraction, then slowly release the tension and return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Pull the V-bar toward your upper abdomen, keeping your elbows close and driving them back behind your torso for maximum lat contraction.
- Maintain a slight arch in your lower back and keep your chest tall throughout. Think about pulling your chest to the handle.
- Fully extend your arms on the return and let your shoulder blades protract to get a deep lat stretch before the next rep.

## Common mistakes

- Excessive torso swinging back and forth, which uses momentum and reduces the time under tension for the back muscles.
- Pulling the handle too high toward the chest, which recruits the upper traps and rear delts instead of the lats.
- Rounding the lower back, especially at the fully extended position, which stresses the lumbar discs.
