## How to perform

1. Sit in the leg press machine and place your feet on the lower portion of the footplate, with only the balls of your feet on the platform and heels hanging off.
2. Release the safety handles and extend your legs without locking your knees.
3. Push through the balls of your feet, extending your ankles to raise the weight.
4. Hold the contracted position briefly, feeling the squeeze in your calves.
5. Slowly lower your heels back down, allowing your calves to stretch.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
7. When finished, carefully re-engage the safety handles.

## Pro tips

- Place only the balls of your feet on the edge of the platform with your heels hanging off for full range of motion.
- Push through the big toe side of your foot to ensure the medial gastrocnemius is fully engaged.
- Use a slow, controlled tempo: 2 seconds up, 2-second hold, 3 seconds down.

## Common mistakes

- Placing the entire foot on the platform, which drastically limits the range of motion at the ankle.
- Locking the knees completely, which can hyperextend the joint under heavy loads.
- Using too much weight and bouncing through a tiny range of motion instead of getting a full stretch and contraction.
