## How to perform

1. Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell in one hand, letting it hang down by your side.
2. Keeping your back straight and your core engaged, slowly bend sideways at the waist towards the opposite side of the dumbbell, lowering the weight as far as you comfortably can.
3. Pause for a moment, then slowly return to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch sides and repeat.

## Pro tips

- Hold the dumbbell in one hand and bend toward the opposite side, using the obliques on the dumbbell side to control the movement.
- Keep the movement strictly lateral, avoiding any forward or backward lean, to isolate the obliques.
- Return to a fully upright position (not leaning to the dumbbell side) to complete the full range of motion.

## Common mistakes

- Holding dumbbells in both hands, which counterbalances the load and eliminates the oblique resistance.
- Bending forward or twisting instead of moving strictly side to side, which recruits the lower back instead of the obliques.
- Moving too fast and using momentum rather than controlled lateral flexion.

## FAQ

### Will Dumbbell Side Bends make my waist thicker?

They can slightly increase oblique muscle size over time. If a narrow waist is your priority, use light weight and moderate reps rather than going heavy.

### Should I hold a dumbbell in both hands for side bends?

No. Hold the dumbbell in one hand only. Two dumbbells counterbalance each other and remove the oblique stimulus.

### How heavy should I go on side bends?

Moderate weight for 12-20 reps per side is effective. Very heavy side bends can strain the lower back and are unnecessary for oblique development.

The Dumbbell Side Bend primarily targets the abs, with secondary activation in the obliques. It's classified as a strength exercise for the core.
