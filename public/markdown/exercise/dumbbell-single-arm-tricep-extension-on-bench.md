4. Lower the dumbbell behind your head by bending your elbow, keeping your upper arm stationary.
5. Extend your arm back up to the starting position, fully straightening your elbow.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch arms.

## Pro tips

- Keep your upper arm vertical and close to your head, with only the forearm moving to isolate the triceps long head.
- Lower the dumbbell behind your head slowly until you feel a deep stretch in the triceps, then extend back up.
- Use your free hand on the bench for stability so you can fully concentrate on the working arm.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the elbow drift forward during the lowering phase, which reduces the stretch on the triceps long head.
- Arching the lower back excessively as the dumbbell goes behind the head, putting stress on the spine.
- Using too much weight, causing the shoulder to assist by moving the upper arm rather than isolating the elbow extension.
