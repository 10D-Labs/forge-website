2. Rest your forearms on your thighs, allowing your wrists to hang off the edge.
3. Slowly curl your wrists upward, bringing the barbell towards your body.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the barbell back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Rest your forearms on your thighs with your wrists hanging over the edge and extend (raise) your knuckles toward the ceiling.
- Use a very light bar since the wrist extensors are small muscles; 10-30 lbs is plenty for most people.
- Control both the lifting and lowering phases with a 2-second tempo in each direction.

## Common mistakes

- Using too much weight and compensating with a jerky, bouncing motion that strains the wrist.
- Moving the forearms off the thighs during the curl, which allows the bigger forearm flexors to assist.
- Performing partial reps by not fully lowering the wrists between reps.
