## How to perform

1. Lie on your side with your legs straight.
2. Bend your top leg and grab your ankle or foot with your hand.
3. Gently pull your ankle or foot towards your glutes until you feel a stretch in your quads.
4. Hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds.
5. Release the stretch and repeat on the other side.

## Pro tips

- Keep your knees close together and your hips stacked to ensure a true quad stretch without hip rotation.
- Gently push your hips forward to increase the stretch through the hip flexors and the rectus femoris.
- Breathe deeply and relax into the stretch rather than forcing the heel aggressively toward your glutes.

## Common mistakes

- Arching the lower back excessively, which compresses the lumbar spine instead of stretching the quads.
- Letting the top knee drift forward past the bottom knee, which reduces the stretch intensity.
- Holding the stretch for too short a duration to produce any meaningful flexibility gains.
