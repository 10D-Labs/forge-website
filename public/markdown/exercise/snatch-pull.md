## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and the barbell on the ground in front of you.
2. Bend your knees and hinge at the hips to lower into a squat position, gripping the barbell with an overhand grip.
3. Keep your back straight and chest up as you drive through your heels to lift the barbell off the ground, extending your hips and knees.
4. As the barbell reaches hip level, explosively pull it upwards, shrugging your shoulders and pulling your elbows high and to the sides.
5. As the barbell reaches its highest point, quickly drop underneath it, pulling yourself into a deep squat position.
6. Catch the barbell overhead with your arms fully extended and your knees bent.
7. Stand up by extending your hips and knees, keeping the barbell overhead.
8. Lower the barbell back down to the starting position by reversing the movement.
9. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use a wide (snatch) grip with the bar starting on the floor and your hips lower than in a Deadlift.
- Accelerate the bar aggressively through the second pull (hip extension phase), shrugging powerfully at the top.
- Keep the bar close to your body throughout the entire pull; it should almost brush your thighs.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling with the arms too early instead of driving through the legs and hips first.
- Letting the hips rise faster than the shoulders off the floor, which turns it into a stiff-leg pull.
- Not achieving full hip extension before shrugging, which limits power output.

## FAQ

### What is the Snatch Pull used for?

The Snatch Pull is a training exercise for the snatch that develops the pulling mechanics (first and second pull) without catching the bar overhead. It builds explosive hip power and upper back strength.

### What's the difference between a Snatch Pull and a clean pull?

The grip width is wider on a Snatch Pull (wide/snatch grip vs shoulder-width for clean pull), and the pulling mechanics are slightly different. The Snatch Pull starts with hips lower and has a longer range of motion.

### How heavy should I go on Snatch Pulls?

Use 90-110% of your snatch max. The goal is explosive speed and proper pulling mechanics, not maximal weight. If the bar speed slows significantly, the weight is too heavy.

### What muscles does the Snatch Pull work?

The Snatch Pull primarily targets the quads, with secondary activation in the hamstrings, glutes, calves. It's classified as a strength exercise for the legs.

### Is the Snatch Pull good for beginners?
