3. Keeping your back straight and core engaged, exhale and lift the barbell straight up towards your chin, leading with your elbows.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then inhale and slowly lower the barbell back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Pull the bar up along your body with your elbows leading and rising higher than your hands.
- Stop when your elbows reach shoulder height; going higher increases shoulder impingement risk.
- Use a grip slightly wider than shoulder width to reduce internal rotation stress on the shoulder joint.

## Common mistakes

- Using a very narrow grip, which forces excessive internal rotation and increases the risk of shoulder impingement.
- Pulling the bar too high above shoulder level, which compresses the supraspinatus tendon.
- Using heavy weight and swinging the body to heave the bar up.
