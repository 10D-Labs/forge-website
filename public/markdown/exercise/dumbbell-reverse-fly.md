## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand.
2. Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight.
3. Extend your arms straight down in front of you, palms facing each other.
4. Keeping a slight bend in your elbows, raise your arms out to the sides until they are parallel to the ground.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your arms back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hinge at the hips and let the dumbbells hang directly below your shoulders, then raise them out to the sides in a wide arc.
- Keep your shoulder blades pulled together at the top of each rep for one second to maximize rear delt and rhomboid contraction.
- Maintain a slight 15-degree bend in your elbows throughout, as if you are hugging a large tree.

## Common mistakes

- Using too much arm bend, which turns the fly into a row and shifts the load from rear delts to the lats.
- Jerking the torso upward with each rep to generate momentum instead of raising the arms in isolation.
- Not hinging forward enough, which reduces the angle needed to properly target the posterior delts.

## FAQ

Yes. The reverse pec deck machine provides consistent resistance and makes it easier to isolate the rear delts, but dumbbells offer more range of motion.

### How many sets per week for rear delts?

Most people benefit from 8-12 sets per week of direct rear delt work, split across 2-3 sessions.
