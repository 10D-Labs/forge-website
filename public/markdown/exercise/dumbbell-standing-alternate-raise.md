## Pro tips

- Alternate raising one dumbbell to the side at a time, which allows you to focus on each deltoid individually.
- Keep your body completely still and upright while raising one arm; do not lean or shift your weight.
- Lower the working arm fully before raising the other side to ensure each rep gets full range of motion.

## Common mistakes

- Swaying the body from side to side as you alternate arms, using momentum instead of deltoid strength.
- Raising both arms simultaneously instead of truly alternating, which changes the exercise.
- Shrugging the shoulder on the raising side, which recruits the upper traps instead of isolating the lateral delt.
