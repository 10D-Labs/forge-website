## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent.
2. Hold the cable handle with an overhand grip, palms facing down, and your arms fully extended in front of you.
3. Keeping your arms straight, raise the cable handle up to shoulder level.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the cable handle back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Stand with the cable running between your legs from a low pulley behind you to keep constant tension on the front delts throughout the entire range.
- Stop the raise at shoulder height. Going higher shifts the work from the anterior deltoid to the upper traps.
- Use a thumbs-up or neutral grip to reduce Internal Shoulder Rotation stress while still hitting the front delt effectively.

## Common mistakes

- Swinging the torso backward to generate momentum, especially as fatigue sets in. Keep your torso completely still.
- Locking the elbows fully straight, which places unnecessary stress on the elbow joint. Maintain a very slight bend.
- Raising the cable too high above shoulder level, which recruits the traps and reduces front delt isolation.
