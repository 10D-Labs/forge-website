## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in one hand with your palm facing your body.
2. Keep your back straight and your core engaged throughout the exercise.
3. Raise the dumbbell to the side, keeping your arm straight and your palm facing down.
4. Continue lifting until your arm is parallel to the ground.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch to the other arm.

## Pro tips

- Hold onto a sturdy object with your free hand for balance, which lets you focus purely on the working shoulder.
- Lead the movement with your elbow, keeping the wrist slightly below elbow height to maintain lateral delt focus.
- Lean slightly away from the working side (10-15 degrees) to increase the effective range of motion on the lateral delt.

## Common mistakes

- Using the whole body to swing the weight up by shifting your torso, negating the isolation benefit of single arm work.
- Raising the arm too high above shoulder level, which shifts the load to the upper traps.
- Internally rotating the shoulder (thumb pointing down) excessively, which can cause impingement over time.
