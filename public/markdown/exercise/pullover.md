## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat and handles of the machine to a comfortable position.
2. Sit on the machine with your back against the pad and grasp the handles with an overhand grip.
3. Keep your arms slightly bent and your core engaged.
4. Slowly pull the handles towards your chest, squeezing your lats.
5. Pause for a moment at the peak contraction, then slowly return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Focus on pulling with your lats, not your arms. Imagine driving your elbows down toward your hips.
- Keep a slight arch in your upper back and your chest lifted throughout the movement.
- Control the return phase and do not let the weight stack pull your arms back too fast.

## Common mistakes

- Using the arms to pull instead of initiating the movement from the lats, which turns it into a tricep exercise.
- Rounding the upper back, which reduces lat engagement and can strain the shoulder joint.
- Going too heavy and using momentum, which eliminates the lat stretch at the top of the movement.
