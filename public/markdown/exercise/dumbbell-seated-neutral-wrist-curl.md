## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with your feet flat on the ground and hold a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing each other.
2. Rest your forearms on your thighs, allowing the dumbbells to hang down.
3. Keeping your wrists in a neutral position, curl the dumbbells up towards your shoulders.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hold the dumbbells in a neutral (hammer) grip with thumbs pointing up and rest your forearms on your thighs.
- Curl your wrists upward in the hammer position to target the brachioradialis along the outer forearm.
- Keep movements slow and controlled since the neutral wrist position works smaller stabilizer muscles.

## Common mistakes

- Rotating the wrists out of the neutral position during the curl, which changes the targeted muscles.
- Moving from the elbow instead of isolating the movement to the wrist joint only.
- Using too heavy a dumbbell that forces compensatory movements from the forearm and upper arm.
