## How to perform

1. Set an incline bench to a 45 degree angle and sit on it with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing each other.
2. Lie back on the bench and press the dumbbells up to the starting position, directly above your chest, with your arms extended.
3. Lower the dumbbells out to the sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch in your chest.
4. As you lower the dumbbells, rotate your wrists so that your palms face forward at the bottom of the movement.
5. Reverse the motion and bring the dumbbells back up to the starting position, squeezing your chest muscles together at the top.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Rotate your wrists slowly and deliberately during the lowering phase so palms face forward at the bottom, maximizing the chest stretch.
- Keep a consistent slight bend in your elbows throughout the movement to protect the shoulder joint during the rotation.
- Lower the dumbbells until you feel a deep stretch in the chest, but stop before any shoulder discomfort begins.

## Common mistakes

- Rotating the wrists too quickly or jerking the twist, which can strain the rotator cuff under load.
- Going too heavy on this exercise, since the twisting component adds instability that requires lighter weights for proper control.
- Flaring the elbows too wide at the bottom, which puts excessive stress on the shoulder joint, especially combined with the rotation.
