## How to perform

1. Stand facing the ski ergometer and grasp the handles.
2. Start in a tall position with arms extended overhead.
3. Pull the handles down powerfully while hinging at the hips.
4. Allow your arms to swing back naturally as you complete the pull.

6. Continue until you reach your target distance.

## Pro tips

- Initiate each pull with a powerful hip hinge, snapping your hips back as your arms drive the handles down.
- Extend fully overhead between each pull to maximize the range of motion and stretch the lats.
- Keep your core braced throughout the entire movement; the power comes from the hip hinge, not the arms.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling with the arms only and not using the hip hinge, which limits power output and exhausts the arms quickly.
- Standing too upright and not hinging at the hips, reducing the lat and posterior chain engagement.
- Not extending the arms fully overhead between pulls, which shortens the stroke and reduces efficiency.
