## How to perform

1. Lie flat on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground.
2. Engage your glutes and lift your hips off the ground, forming a straight line from your knees to your shoulders.
3. While keeping your hips lifted, lift one foot off the ground and bring your knee towards your chest.
4. Lower your foot back to the ground and repeat the movement with the other leg.
5. Continue alternating legs in a marching motion while maintaining the bridge position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your hips level and completely still as you lift each knee; any hip drop means you need to reduce the tempo.
- Drive through the planted foot's heel to maintain the bridge height while the opposite leg lifts.
- Lift each knee slowly (2 seconds up, 2 seconds down) rather than quickly to maximize glute activation.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the hips drop on the side of the lifting leg, which means the stabilizing glute isn't firing properly.
- Lifting the knee too quickly and using momentum instead of controlled hip flexion.
- Placing the feet too far from the body, which shifts the load from the glutes to the hamstrings.

## FAQ

### What does the marching component add to a glute bridge?

The alternating leg lift forces each glute to stabilize independently while maintaining the bridge, turning a bilateral exercise into a unilateral stability challenge.

### Are Glute Bridge Marches good for runners?

Excellent. They build single-leg glute stability, which is exactly what's needed during the stance phase of running. They help fix hip drop and knee caving during running.

### How many reps should I do?

10-15 marches per leg (20-30 total) for 2-3 sets. Focus on keeping the hips perfectly level rather than rushing through reps.

### What muscles does the Glute Bridge March work?

The Glute Bridge March primarily targets the glutes, with secondary activation in the hamstrings, quadriceps. It's classified as a strength exercise for the legs.

### Is the Glute Bridge March good for beginners?

The Glute Bridge March is rated as intermediate. Beginners should build a base of glutes strength with easier variations first.
