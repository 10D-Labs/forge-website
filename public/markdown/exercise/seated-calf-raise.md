## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height so that your knees are slightly bent and your feet are flat on the footplate.
2. Place your toes on the footplate with your heels hanging off the edge.
3. Grasp the handles or the sides of the seat for stability.
4. Push through the balls of your feet to raise your heels as high as possible.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your heels back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Position the pad snugly over your lower thighs (just above the knees) and place the balls of your feet on the footplate with heels hanging off.
- Press through the balls of your feet and hold the top position for 2 seconds, squeezing the calves hard.
- Lower your heels below the footplate as far as possible to get a full stretch at the bottom of each rep.

## Common mistakes

- Bouncing at the bottom to generate momentum instead of performing controlled, full-range reps.
- Not going through the full range of motion, especially at the bottom where the stretch is most beneficial.
- Using too much weight and only achieving partial reps that barely move through 2-3 inches.

## FAQ

### What's the difference between seated and Standing Calf Raises?

Seated Calf Raises primarily target the soleus (the deeper calf muscle) because the bent knee reduces gastrocnemius involvement. Standing Calf Raises target the gastrocnemius (the larger, visible calf muscle) more. Both are needed for complete calf development.

### Why won't my calves grow?

Calves are stubborn because they're used to high-volume daily activity (walking). They need higher rep ranges (12-20 reps), full range of motion with pauses at the top and bottom, and higher training frequency (3-4 times per week) to grow.

### How many sets of calf raises should I do?

Most people need 12-20 sets per week spread across 3-4 sessions. Start with 4 sets of 15-20 reps per session and increase volume gradually.

### What muscles does the Seated Calf Raise work?

The Seated Calf Raise primarily targets the calves, with secondary activation in the soleus, ankle stabilizers. It's classified as a strength exercise for the legs.

### Is the Seated Calf Raise good for beginners?

Yes, the Seated Calf Raise is rated as a beginner-level exercise. It's a great starting point for building calves strength.
