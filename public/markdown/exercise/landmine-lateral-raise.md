## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent.
2. Hold the barbell with an overhand grip, resting it on the front of your shoulders.
3. Keeping your core engaged and back straight, lift the barbell up and away from your body, raising it to shoulder height.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the barbell back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Stand with the end of the barbell at your side and lift it up and away in a lateral arc to target the medial deltoid.
- Keep a slight bend in your elbow and lead the lift with the back of your hand, not the front.
- Control the descent and do not let the barbell drop; the eccentric phase is valuable for shoulder development.

## Common mistakes

- Standing too close to the landmine base, which changes the resistance angle and reduces lateral delt activation.
- Using too much body English by leaning to the opposite side to lift the barbell, which reduces shoulder isolation.
- Lifting the bar too high past shoulder level, which impinges the shoulder and shifts work to the traps.
