## How to perform

1. Start in a pushup position with your hands shoulder-width apart and one hand placed slightly wider than the other.
2. Engage your core and lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows, keeping your back straight.
3. As you lower yourself, shift your weight to one side and lift the opposite arm off the ground, extending it straight out to the side.
4. Push through your chest and triceps to raise your body back up to the starting position, while simultaneously lowering your extended arm back to the ground.
5. Repeat the movement, alternating the arm you extend with each repetition.

## Pro tips

- Spread your feet wider than shoulder width to create a stable three-point base.
- Place your working hand slightly inside of center (toward the midline) rather than directly under the shoulder.
- Actively resist rotation by bracing your core and pressing your free hand into your thigh or behind your back.

## Common mistakes

- Keeping feet close together, which makes balance nearly impossible and forces excessive torso rotation.
- Rotating the torso dramatically instead of keeping the hips and shoulders as square to the floor as possible.
- Not going through the full range of motion, only doing partial reps from the top.
