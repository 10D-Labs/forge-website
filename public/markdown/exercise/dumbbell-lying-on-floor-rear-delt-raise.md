3. Engaging your shoulder muscles, lift your arms up and out to the sides, squeezing your shoulder blades together.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your arms back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Press your forehead into the floor to keep your neck neutral and prevent lifting your head during the raise.
- Raise the dumbbells out to the sides until your arms are roughly parallel with the floor, no higher.
- Use a 1-2 second pause at the top to confirm you feel the rear delts working, not the traps.

## Common mistakes

- Lifting the chest off the floor during the raise, which turns it into a Back Extension and reduces rear delt isolation.
- Using too heavy a weight, which forces the traps and rhomboids to take over the movement.
- Raising the arms too far behind the body instead of out to the sides, which shifts emphasis to the lats.
