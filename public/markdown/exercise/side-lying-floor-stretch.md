## Pro tips

- Reach your top arm as far overhead as possible while keeping it in line with your body to maximize the lat and oblique stretch.
- Breathe deeply into the stretched side to expand the ribcage and increase the stretch effect.
- Keep your hips stacked (do not roll forward or backward) to maintain proper alignment during the stretch.

## Common mistakes

- Rolling the torso forward or backward instead of staying purely on the side, which changes the stretch target.
- Not holding the stretch long enough to get a meaningful release (minimum 20 seconds per side).
- Tensing the muscles being stretched instead of consciously relaxing into the position.
