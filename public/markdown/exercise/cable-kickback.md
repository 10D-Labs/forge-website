## How to perform

1. Stand facing a cable machine with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Hold the cable handle with your right hand and step back to create tension in the cable.
3. Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight.
4. Keep your upper arm close to your body and your elbow bent at a 90 degree angle.
5. Extend your forearm backward, straightening your arm fully.
6. Pause for a moment, then slowly return to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch sides.

## Pro tips

- Keep your upper arm pinned to your side and only move the forearm to isolate the triceps.
- Fully extend the arm at the back and squeeze the tricep for a one-second hold at peak contraction.
- Use a rope attachment or single handle at ankle height for the best range of motion.

## Common mistakes

- Swinging the upper arm back and forth instead of keeping it stationary, which turns it into a shoulder exercise.
- Using too much weight, which prevents full elbow extension and reduces the effectiveness of the movement.
- Standing too upright instead of hinging forward at the hips, which limits the range of motion.
