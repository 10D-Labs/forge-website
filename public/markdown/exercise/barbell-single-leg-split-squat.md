## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a barbell across your upper back.
2. Take a large step forward with one leg, keeping your torso upright.
3. Lower your body by bending your front knee and hip, while keeping your back leg straight.
4. Continue lowering until your front thigh is parallel to the ground.
5. Pause for a moment, then push through your front heel to return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch legs.

## Pro tips

- Keep your front foot flat and drive through the heel; your back leg is for balance, not for pushing.
- Lower until your front thigh is parallel to the floor, maintaining an upright torso with the bar on your back.
- Start with a lunge-length step forward and adjust based on what lets you keep a vertical front shin.

## Common mistakes

- Placing the front foot too close to the back foot, which makes balancing difficult and stresses the front knee.
- Leaning forward excessively, shifting the load to the lower back instead of the front leg.
- Letting the front knee drift inward on the descent, which stresses the knee ligaments.
