## How to perform

1. Start in a pushup position with your hands shoulder-width apart and your body straight.
2. Engage your core and slowly shift your weight forward, bringing your shoulders past your hands.
3. Keep your elbows slightly bent and your body straight as you lean forward.
4. Hold this position for a few seconds, then slowly return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Start with your shoulders stacked over your wrists and gradually shift forward in small increments across sessions.
- Turn your fingers outward or use parallettes to reduce the extreme wrist extension angle.
- Hold each lean position for 15-30 seconds before progressing further forward to build tendon resilience.

## Common mistakes

- Bending the elbows to compensate for insufficient shoulder strength, turning it into a pseudo Pushup position.
- Leaning forward too aggressively in early sessions and straining the wrists or shoulders.
- Letting the hips sag, which means your core isn't contributing to the hold and increases lower back stress.
