## How to perform

1. Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold the ez barbell with an underhand grip.
2. Keep your elbows close to your torso and your upper arms stationary throughout the exercise.
3. Curl the barbell upwards by contracting your biceps, while exhaling.
4. Continue to raise the barbell until your biceps are fully contracted and the barbell is at shoulder level.
5. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
6. Slowly begin to bring the barbell back to the starting position as you inhale.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use an overhand (pronated) grip on the EZ bar to shift the load onto the brachioradialis and brachialis rather than the biceps.
- Keep your wrists rigid and in line with your forearms throughout the curl to prevent strain.
- Use a lighter weight than you'd use for standard curls since the reverse grip reduces your mechanical advantage.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the wrists bend backward under the load, which strains the wrist extensors and reduces forearm activation.
- Using the same heavy weight as regular curls, leading to poor form and excessive body swing.
- Rushing through reps instead of focusing on the squeeze at the top and a controlled lowering phase.
