4. Keep your back straight and core engaged.
5. Raise the barbell up towards the ceiling, leading with your elbows.
6. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the barbell back down to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep the movement controlled and avoid using momentum; the serratus anterior is a small muscle.
- Focus on protracting your shoulder blades (pushing them apart) at the top of the movement.

## Common mistakes

- Turning it into a shrug by just raising the shoulders straight up instead of protracting forward.
- Using too much weight and compensating with the traps instead of the serratus.
- Leaning back instead of maintaining the incline angle throughout the movement.

## FAQ

### What does the serratus anterior do?

The serratus anterior protracts and stabilizes the scapula. Strong serratus muscles improve overhead pressing strength, reduce shoulder impingement risk, and create the 'serrated' look along the ribcage.

### Why should I train the serratus anterior?

A weak serratus is a common cause of scapular winging and shoulder instability. Training it improves overhead movement quality and reduces injury risk during pressing exercises.

The serratus responds well to moderate to high reps (12-20) with lighter weight. Focus on feeling the muscle work rather than chasing heavy loads.

The Smith Incline Shoulder Raises primarily targets the serratus, with secondary activation in the shoulders, trapezius. It's classified as a strength exercise for the core.
