## How to perform

1. Lie flat on a bench with your feet flat on the ground and your back pressed against the bench.
2. Grasp the barbell with a wide grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3. Lift the barbell off the rack and hold it directly above your chest with your arms fully extended.
4. Lower the barbell slowly towards your chest, keeping your elbows slightly flared out.
5. Pause for a moment when the barbell touches your chest, then push it back up to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Grip the bar at about 1.5-2 times shoulder width and lower it to the mid-chest area.
- The wide grip increases the stretch across the pec fibers, so control the descent carefully.
- Keep the shoulder blades retracted and your feet planted firmly for a stable base.

## Common mistakes

- Gripping so wide that the wrists bend backward, reducing pressing power and risking wrist injury.
- Bouncing the bar off the chest, which is more dangerous with a wide grip because the shoulders are in a more vulnerable position.
- Lowering the bar too high (toward the neck) instead of to the mid-chest.
