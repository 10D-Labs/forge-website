## How to perform

1. Sit on a cable machine with your feet flat on the ground and your back straight.
2. Grasp the cable attachment with an underhand grip, palms facing up, and your arms fully extended.
3. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the cable attachment towards your shoulders, contracting your biceps.
4. Pause for a moment at the top of the movement, squeezing your biceps.
5. Inhale and slowly lower the cable attachment back to the starting position, fully extending your arms.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Sit upright with your back straight and feet flat on the floor to eliminate any momentum from the lower body.
- Keep your elbows pinned to your sides throughout the movement; they should not move forward or backward.
- Use a controlled 2-second concentric and 3-second eccentric tempo for maximum bicep stimulus.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning back to pull the weight up, which uses the lower back instead of the biceps.
- Letting the elbows drift forward at the top of the curl, shifting work to the front deltoids.
- Not fully extending the arms at the bottom, which reduces the stretch and limits range of motion.

## FAQ

### Why do seated Cable Curls instead of standing?

Sitting down removes the ability to use leg drive, hip swing, or back lean to cheat the weight up. It forces stricter bicep isolation.

### What attachment works best for seated Cable Curls?

A straight bar or EZ bar attachment both work well. For a more unilateral approach, use a rope attachment and curl with a neutral grip.

### Where should I position the seat relative to the cable?

Sit close enough that there's tension on the cable even at full arm extension. If the weight stack bottoms out at the bottom of the rep, move the bench back slightly.

### What muscles does the Cable Seated Curl work?

The Cable Seated Curl primarily targets the biceps, with secondary activation in the forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.

### Is the Cable Seated Curl good for beginners?

Yes, the Cable Seated Curl is rated as a beginner-level exercise. It's a great starting point for building biceps strength.
