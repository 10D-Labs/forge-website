## How to perform

1. Sit on a cable machine with your feet flat on the ground and your knees bent.
2. Hold the cable handle with both hands and position it behind your head.
3. Engage your abs and slowly curl your upper body forward, bringing your chest towards your knees.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Sit upright and hold the rope behind your head. Curl your spine by driving your rib cage down toward your pelvis, not by bending at the hips.
- Exhale forcefully at the bottom of the crunch to help contract the rectus abdominis fully.
- Use a slow eccentric (2-3 seconds) back to the upright position to keep the abs under tension longer.

## Common mistakes

- Hinging at the hips instead of flexing the spine, which turns this into a hip flexor exercise rather than an ab exercise.
- Pulling the rope with the arms during the crunch, which engages the lats and takes tension off the abs.
- Using too much weight, which prevents full spinal flexion and limits the range of motion.
