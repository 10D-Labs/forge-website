1. Set up an incline bench at a 45 degree angle.
2. Lie face down on the bench with your chest against the pad and your feet flat on the ground.
3. Grasp the barbell with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
4. Keep your back straight and your core engaged.

6. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position.

## Pro tips

- Press your chest firmly into the incline pad throughout the movement; if your chest lifts off, the weight is too heavy.
- Pull the bar toward your lower chest, squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top of every rep.
- The incline supports your torso, so you can focus entirely on back contraction without worrying about lower back fatigue.

## Common mistakes

- Lifting the chest off the pad to use momentum, which negates the main advantage of the incline support.
- Pulling the bar to the wrong spot (too high toward the neck or too low toward the stomach).
- Using too heavy a weight and shrugging the shoulders up instead of retracting the shoulder blades.
