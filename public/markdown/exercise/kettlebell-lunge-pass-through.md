## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a kettlebell in front of your chest with both hands.
2. Take a step forward with your right foot, lowering your body into a lunge position.
3. As you lunge forward, pass the kettlebell under your right thigh and transfer it to your left hand.
4. Push off with your right foot to return to the starting position, while simultaneously passing the kettlebell back to your right hand.
5. Repeat the lunge on the opposite side, passing the kettlebell under your left thigh.
6. Continue alternating lunges and passing the kettlebell between hands for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Pass the kettlebell under your front thigh at the bottom of the lunge, switching hands smoothly without pausing.
- Keep your torso upright throughout the pass. The transfer happens under the leg, not in front of your body.
- Step with control and ensure your front knee stays behind or over your toes, not past them.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning forward excessively during the pass, which puts stress on the lower back and destabilizes the lunge.
- Taking too short a step, which causes the knee to push past the toes and increases joint stress.
- Rushing the hand-off and fumbling the kettlebell during the pass-through.
