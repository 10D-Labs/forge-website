## How to perform

1. Kneel on a pad with your feet anchored under a stable surface or held by a partner.
2. Keep your body straight from knees to head, arms ready in front of you.
3. Slowly lower yourself forward by extending at the knees, controlling the descent with your hamstrings.
4. Lower as far as you can while maintaining control, using your hands to catch yourself if needed.
5. Push off the ground slightly if needed and use your hamstrings to pull yourself back up to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Control the lowering phase as slowly as possible; the eccentric is where the hamstring strengthening happens.
- Keep your body straight from knees to head throughout the descent; don't break at the hips.
- Use your hands to catch yourself at the bottom and give a gentle push to assist on the way back up as needed.

## Common mistakes

- Bending at the hips instead of maintaining a straight body line, which shifts work away from the hamstrings.
- Dropping uncontrolled to the floor instead of lowering slowly, which misses the muscle-building eccentric phase.
- Skipping this exercise because you can't do a full rep; even partial-range eccentrics are highly effective.
