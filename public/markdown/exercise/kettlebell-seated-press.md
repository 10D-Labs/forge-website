## How to perform

2. Hold a kettlebell in each hand at shoulder height, palms facing forward.
3. Press the kettlebells overhead, fully extending your arms.
4. Lower the kettlebells back to shoulder height.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Sit tall with no back support if possible, which forces your core to stabilize rather than relying on a bench.
- Clean the kettlebells to the rack position and press straight up, finishing with biceps by your ears.
- Avoid flaring your ribcage by exhaling hard as you press and pulling your ribcage down.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning back excessively to use momentum, especially on the last few reps.
- Not sitting tall with a neutral spine, which reduces shoulder range of motion and increases injury risk.
- Using too wide a foot stance, which makes the seated position unstable.
