## How to perform

1. Sit on the floor with your legs extended in front of you.
2. Place your hands on the floor beside your hips, fingers pointing forward.
3. Engage your core and lift your legs off the ground, keeping them straight.
4. Try to bring your legs parallel to the floor, forming an 'L' shape with your body.
5. Hold this position for as long as you can.
6. Slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Press your palms flat into the floor and push your shoulders down (depress them) to create maximal height.
- Actively squeeze your quads to lock out your knees and point your toes to create tension through the whole leg.
- If you can't lift fully off the ground, use parallettes or yoga blocks to give yourself extra clearance.

## Common mistakes

- Bending the knees because of tight hamstrings, which turns it into a tuck sit instead of an L-sit.
- Letting the shoulders shrug up toward the ears instead of actively pressing them down.
- Placing the hands too far forward or back instead of right next to the hips, which changes the leverage.

## FAQ

### Why can't I lift my legs off the floor in an L-sit?

Usually it's either tight hamstrings (preventing straight legs) or weak hip flexors (preventing the lift). Stretch your hamstrings daily and strengthen hip flexors with Hanging Leg Raises.

### How long should I hold an L-sit?

A 15-second hold with straight legs is a solid intermediate benchmark. Start with 5-second holds and add 2-3 seconds per week.

### Are parallettes cheating for L-sits?

No. Parallettes give you more clearance and are actually the standard apparatus for L-sits in gymnastics. Floor L-sits are harder due to less clearance, not better.

### What muscles does the L-sit on Floor work?

The L-sit on Floor primarily targets the abs, with secondary activation in the hip flexors. It's classified as a strength exercise for the core.

### Is the L-sit on Floor good for beginners?

The L-sit on Floor is an advanced exercise. Beginners should master fundamental core movements first.
