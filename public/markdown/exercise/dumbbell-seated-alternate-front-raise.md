## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with your back straight and feet flat on the ground.
2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing your body and arms extended down by your sides.
3. Keeping your arms straight, raise one dumbbell in front of you until it is parallel to the ground.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbell back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat with the other arm.
6. Alternate between arms for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your back pressed against the bench and raise one dumbbell at a time to shoulder height with a straight arm and palm facing down.
- Alternate arms smoothly, lowering one as the other rises, to maintain a steady rhythm.
- Avoid swinging the body or pushing off the bench with your back; the seated position should enforce strict form.

- Leaning back to assist the raise, which uses momentum and reduces anterior deltoid isolation.
- Raising the dumbbell above shoulder height, which shifts the load from the front delt to the upper traps.
- Rushing the alternating pattern and not giving each arm a complete range of motion.
