## How to perform

1. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointing forward.
2. Place the barbell across your upper back, resting it on your traps.
3. Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight.
4. Lower your torso until it is parallel to the ground, feeling a stretch in your hamstrings.
5. Engage your glutes and hamstrings to raise your torso back up to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hinge at the hips, not the waist; push your glutes back as if closing a car door with your butt.
- Keep a slight bend in the knees (about 15-20 degrees) throughout the movement to protect the lower back.
- Stop the descent when your torso is parallel to the floor or when you feel a strong stretch in the hamstrings.

## Common mistakes

- Rounding the lower back during the hinge, which puts dangerous shear forces on the lumbar spine.
- Going too heavy before mastering the hip hinge pattern, which increases injury risk significantly.
- Straightening the legs during the descent, turning it into a stiff-leg version that's harder on the lower back.
