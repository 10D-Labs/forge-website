2. Take a step forward with your right foot, lowering your body into a lunge position.
3. As you lunge forward, swing the weights forward and upward, keeping your arms straight.
4. Push off with your right foot and return to the starting position, swinging the weights back down.
5. Repeat with your left foot and continue alternating legs for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Time the swing so the weights reach their highest point as you hit the bottom of the lunge.
- Use a light weight and focus on coordinating the swing with the lunge tempo.
- Brace your core throughout to prevent the swinging weight from pulling you off balance.

## Common mistakes

- Using too heavy a weight, which makes the swing jerky and throws off your lunge balance.
- Letting the swing pull your torso forward instead of staying upright.
- Performing the swing and lunge as two separate movements rather than one coordinated action.
