## How to perform

1. Stand or sit upright with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Extend one arm overhead, bending at the elbow so that your hand reaches towards the opposite shoulder blade.
3. With your other hand, gently pull the elbow of the extended arm towards the opposite side of your head, feeling a stretch in your triceps.
4. Hold the stretch for 15-30 seconds, then release.
5. Repeat on the other side.

## Pro tips

- Apply gentle, steady pressure with the opposite hand; never force the stretch beyond a comfortable pull.
- Keep your head neutral and avoid tilting it forward as you pull the elbow.
- Stand tall and engage your core to prevent arching your lower back during the stretch.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling the elbow too aggressively, which can strain the shoulder joint.
- Arching the lower back to compensate for tight triceps or shoulders.
- Holding the stretch for only a few seconds instead of a meaningful duration.
