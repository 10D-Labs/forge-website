## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height and position yourself on the machine.
2. Place your upper arms on the preacher pad, ensuring your chest is pressed against it.
3. Grasp the handles with a hammer grip (palms facing each other).
4. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the handles towards your shoulders.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, squeezing your biceps.
6. Inhale and slowly lower the handles back to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Press your chest firmly against the preacher pad to prevent your shoulders from lifting during the curl.
- Keep the neutral (hammer) grip throughout; don't let your wrists rotate at the top or bottom of the movement.
- Lower the handles slowly for a 3-second eccentric to fully load the brachialis, which is the primary target with this grip.

## Common mistakes

- Lifting the elbows off the pad at the top of the curl, which recruits the front deltoids and reduces bicep isolation.
- Using too much weight and swinging the body to complete reps, defeating the purpose of the preacher pad.
- Cutting the range of motion short by not fully extending at the bottom.
