## How to perform

2. Stand facing the machine with your feet shoulder-width apart.
3. Grasp the bar with an overhand grip, keeping your arms straight and your palms facing down.
4. Engage your lats and pull the bar down towards your thighs, keeping your arms straight throughout the movement.
5. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then slowly return the bar to the starting position.

## Pro tips

- Stand about two feet from the machine, hinge forward slightly at the hips, and pull the bar in an arc from overhead to your thighs while keeping your arms completely straight.
- Focus on driving the movement with your lats, not your arms. Imagine pushing the bar down with your elbows locked.
- Control the return slowly, feeling the stretch in your lats as the bar rises back to shoulder height.

- Bending the elbows during the pull, which recruits the triceps and reduces lat isolation.
- Standing too far from the machine, which limits the range of motion and changes the resistance angle.
- Using too much weight and rocking the body to move the bar, rather than keeping the torso stationary.
