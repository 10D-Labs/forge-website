5. Continue the circular motion until your hands touch your toes.
6. Reverse the motion and bring your hands back down to the starting position.

## Pro tips

- Clasp your hands behind your back and raise them overhead as you bend forward to add a shoulder stretch component.
- Hinge at the hips and keep your back as flat as possible as you reach toward your toes.
- The circular motion should be controlled and smooth, passing through each position deliberately.

## Common mistakes

- Forcing the clasped hands too far overhead, which strains the shoulders. Only go as far as comfortable.
- Rounding the lower back to reach the floor instead of hinging at the hips with a flat spine.
- Moving through the circular motion too quickly, losing the stretch benefit at each position.
