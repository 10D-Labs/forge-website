## How to perform

1. Stand facing a wall with your feet hip-width apart.
2. Place your hands against the wall at shoulder height.
3. Step your right foot back, keeping your heel on the ground and your leg straight.
4. Bend your left knee and lean forward, keeping your back leg straight and your heel on the ground.
5. Hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds.
6. Switch legs and repeat the stretch.

## Pro tips

- Keep the back leg completely straight and press the heel firmly into the ground to target the gastrocnemius specifically.
- Lean your hips forward toward the wall while keeping your back flat to deepen the stretch gradually.
- For a soleus stretch, slightly bend the back knee while keeping the heel down.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the back heel lift off the ground, which eliminates the calf stretch entirely.
- Pointing the back foot outward instead of keeping it straight ahead, which reduces stretch on the calf and stresses the ankle.
- Bouncing into the stretch instead of holding a steady, sustained position.
