## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and hold a barbell with an overhand grip.
2. Bend forward at the hips, keeping your back straight and your head up.
3. Let the barbell hang in front of you with your arms fully extended.
4. Pull the barbell up towards your chest, keeping your elbows close to your body.
5. Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.
6. Lower the barbell back down to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Stagger your stance with the opposite foot forward for stability, and brace your non-working hand on your knee or a bench.
- Pull the barbell (or the end of the barbell in a landmine setup) toward your hip, not your chest, for maximum lat engagement.
- Keep your torso at roughly 45 degrees throughout and resist rotating toward the working arm.

## Common mistakes

- Rotating the torso to heave the weight up, which uses momentum instead of back strength.
- Standing too upright, which reduces the horizontal pull angle and turns it into a shrug.
- Using the bicep to curl the weight rather than driving the elbow back with the lat and rhomboid.
