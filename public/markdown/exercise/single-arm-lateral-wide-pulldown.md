## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height and position yourself on the machine with your chest against the pad and your feet flat on the floor.
2. Grasp the handle with an overhand grip and fully extend your arm, keeping a slight bend in your elbow.
3. Pull the handle down and across your body towards your opposite hip, squeezing your lat muscle at the bottom of the movement.
4. Slowly return the handle to the starting position, fully extending your arm.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch sides.

## Pro tips

- Pull the handle in a wide arc down toward your opposite hip to maximize lat fiber recruitment across the widest range.
- Lean your torso slightly toward the working side to increase the stretch at the top of the movement.
- Focus on leading with your elbow rather than your hand to ensure the lat does the work, not the biceps.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling straight down instead of in a lateral arc, which turns it into a standard pulldown and reduces the wide lat emphasis.
- Using too much weight and compensating by twisting the torso to pull the handle down.
- Not fully extending the arm at the top, which shortens the range of motion and reduces the lat stretch.

## FAQ

### How does this differ from a regular lat pulldown?

The single-arm lateral path creates a longer arc of motion and a more intense stretch at the top, targeting the lat through a greater range than a straight-down bilateral pulldown.

### Should I lean back during this exercise?

A very slight lean (10-15 degrees) toward the working side is fine to optimize the pull angle, but do not lean back excessively or twist.

### What handle attachment should I use?

A single D-handle or stirrup handle works best. It allows free wrist rotation and a comfortable grip through the full arc of motion.

### What muscles does the Single Arm Lateral Wide Pulldown work?

The Single Arm Lateral Wide Pulldown primarily targets the lats, with secondary activation in the biceps, rhomboids, rear deltoids. It's classified as a strength exercise for the back.

### Is the Single Arm Lateral Wide Pulldown good for beginners?

The Single Arm Lateral Wide Pulldown is rated as intermediate. Beginners should build a base of lats strength with easier variations first.
