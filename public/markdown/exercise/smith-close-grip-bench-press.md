## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height and position yourself on the bench with your feet flat on the ground.
2. Grasp the barbell with a close grip, slightly narrower than shoulder-width apart.
3. Lower the barbell towards your chest, keeping your elbows close to your body.
4. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push the barbell back up to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Place your hands about 12-14 inches apart (just inside shoulder width) to maximize tricep engagement.
- Keep your elbows tucked close to your sides throughout the entire movement.
- Lower the bar to your lower sternum area, not the mid-chest, for optimal tricep mechanics.

## Common mistakes

- Gripping too narrow (hands touching), which places excessive stress on the wrists and doesn't improve tricep activation.
- Flaring the elbows outward, which turns it into a regular bench press and reduces tricep involvement.
- Not achieving full lockout at the top, which is where the triceps contract hardest.
