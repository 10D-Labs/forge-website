## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing your body.
2. Bend forward at the hips, keeping your back straight and your core engaged.
3. Let your arms hang straight down towards the floor, with your elbows slightly bent.
4. Pull the dumbbells up towards your chest, squeezing your shoulder blades together.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.

## Pro tips

- Hinge forward at the hips to about 45 degrees with a slight knee bend. Your back should be flat, not rounded, throughout.
- Pull both dumbbells to your lower rib cage simultaneously, squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top.
- Let the dumbbells hang at full arm extension at the bottom. Do not shorten the range by keeping your arms bent between reps.

## Common mistakes

- Standing too upright, which turns this into a shrug-row hybrid and reduces lat and mid-back engagement.
- Jerking the weights up with momentum and a rounding back instead of a controlled pull.
- Pulling the dumbbells too high toward the chest, which shifts emphasis to the rear delts and traps instead of the lats.
