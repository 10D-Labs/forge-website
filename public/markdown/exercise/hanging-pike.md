## How to perform

1. Hang from a pullup bar with your arms fully extended and your palms facing away from you.
2. Engage your core and lift your legs up towards the bar, keeping them straight.
3. Continue lifting until your body forms a 'V' shape, with your legs parallel to the ground.
4. Hold the position for a moment, then slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Focus on bringing your toes to the bar by curling your pelvis up forcefully rather than just lifting your legs.
- Engage your lats by actively pulling down on the bar to stabilize your upper body and prevent swinging.
- Exhale hard as your legs rise to maximize abdominal contraction at the top.

## Common mistakes

- Using a kipping swing to get the toes up instead of strict core control, which defeats the purpose of the exercise.
- Bending the knees significantly, which turns the pike into a hanging knee raise and reduces ab engagement.
- Relaxing at the bottom and letting the body swing, which makes each subsequent rep rely on momentum.
