## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand.
2. Take a step forward with one foot and position your feet so that your front foot is flat on the ground and your back foot is elevated on a bench or step.
3. Lower your body by bending your front knee and hip, keeping your back knee slightly bent and your back heel off the ground.
4. Continue lowering until your front thigh is parallel to the ground, then push through your front heel to return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch legs and repeat.

## Pro tips

- Elevate the back foot on a bench and lower until your front thigh is parallel to the floor for full glute and quad activation.
- Keep your front shin as vertical as possible by positioning the front foot far enough forward from the bench.
- Drive up through the heel of the front foot to emphasize glute engagement on the way up.

## Common mistakes

- Placing the front foot too close to the bench, which forces the front knee past the toes and increases knee stress.
- Leaning the torso too far forward, which overloads the lower back instead of working the legs.
- Letting the front knee collapse inward during the descent, stressing the knee ligaments.
