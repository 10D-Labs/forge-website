## How to perform

1. Lie flat on a bench with your feet flat on the ground and your head at the end of the bench.
2. Hold the barbell with a reverse grip, palms facing towards your face, and your hands shoulder-width apart.
3. Extend your arms straight up over your chest, keeping your elbows in and your wrists straight.
4. Slowly lower the barbell towards your forehead by bending your elbows, keeping your upper arms stationary.
5. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then extend your arms back up to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use a reverse (supinated) grip with palms facing toward your face and keep your wrists straight throughout.
- Lower the bar toward your forehead by bending only at the elbows; your upper arms should remain vertical.
- Press the bar back up by extending the elbows explosively while maintaining the reverse grip.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the elbows flare outward during the extension, which reduces tricep isolation.
- Lowering the bar too far behind the head, which puts the shoulder joint in a vulnerable position with the reverse grip.
- Using too much weight, which can cause the bar to slip from the unfamiliar grip position.

## FAQ

### Why use a reverse grip for skullcrushers?

The reverse grip shifts more emphasis to the medial head of the triceps and can be easier on the elbows for people who experience pain with the standard overhand grip.

### Is the reverse grip safe for skullcrushers?

Yes, but start with lighter weight to master the grip. Use a spotter if possible, as the supinated grip feels less secure than a standard overhand grip.

### Where should I lower the bar?

Lower to the forehead or just above it. Unlike standard skullcrushers where some lifters go behind the head, the reverse grip version should stay over the face for safety.

### What muscles does the Barbell Reverse Grip Skullcrusher work?

The Barbell Reverse Grip Skullcrusher primarily targets the triceps, with secondary activation in the forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.

### Is the Barbell Reverse Grip Skullcrusher good for beginners?

The Barbell Reverse Grip Skullcrusher is rated as intermediate. Beginners should build a base of triceps strength with easier variations first.
