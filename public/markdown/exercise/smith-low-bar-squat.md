## How to perform

1. Set up the smith machine with the barbell at a height that allows you to comfortably rest it on your upper back.
2. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly turned outwards.
3. Step under the bar and position it across your upper back, resting it on your traps.
4. Grip the bar with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
5. Unrack the bar by straightening your legs and stepping back from the rack.
6. Take a deep breath and brace your core.
7. Initiate the squat by pushing your hips back and bending your knees.
8. Lower your body until your thighs are parallel to the ground or slightly below.
9. Keep your chest up and your back straight throughout the movement.
10. Drive through your heels to stand back up, extending your hips and knees.
11. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Position the bar lower across your rear deltoids and upper back, not on top of your traps like a high bar squat.
- Create a wider stance (slightly outside shoulder width) and push your hips back more than you would with a high bar position.
- Lean your torso forward slightly more than a high bar squat to keep the bar over your midfoot.

## Common mistakes

- Placing the bar too high on the traps, which negates the benefits of the low bar position.
- Keeping the torso too upright, which forces the knees too far forward and reduces posterior chain engagement.
- Not pushing the hips back enough, missing the increased glute and hamstring activation that low bar provides.
