## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold the band in front of your thighs with your palms facing down.
2. Keep your arms straight and lift the band up in front of you until your arms are parallel to the ground.
3. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the band back down to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Raise both arms simultaneously, with one going forward (front raise) and one going to the side (Lateral Raise), then alternate.
- Stop at shoulder height and avoid lifting higher, which recruits the traps instead of the delts.
- Keep a slight bend in the elbows throughout to reduce stress on the elbow joints.

## Common mistakes

- Raising the arms above shoulder height, which shifts the load from the deltoids to the upper traps.
- Shrugging the shoulders as you raise the band, which indicates the weight is too heavy.
- Leaning backward to assist the lift, which takes tension off the shoulders.

## FAQ

### What is the benefit of combining front and Lateral Raises?

It is time-efficient and trains both the anterior and medial deltoid heads in one movement. The alternating pattern also challenges core stability.

### How does band resistance compare to dumbbells for raises?

Bands provide increasing resistance as your arms rise, which means peak tension occurs at shoulder height where the delts are fully contracted. Dumbbells are heaviest at shoulder height due to gravity.

### What band thickness should you use for Lateral Raises?

Use a light band. The long lever arm of straight-arm raises makes even light bands very challenging. Most people overestimate the band they need.

### What muscles does the Band Front Lateral Raise work?

The Band Front Lateral Raise primarily targets the shoulders, with secondary activation in the traps, upper back. It's classified as a strength exercise for the shoulders.

### Is the Band Front Lateral Raise good for beginners?

Yes, the Band Front Lateral Raise is rated as a beginner-level exercise. It's a great starting point for building shoulders strength.
