## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and the barbell on the ground in front of you.
2. Bend your knees and hinge at the hips to lower your torso and grip the barbell with an overhand grip, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3. Keep your back straight and chest lifted as you drive through your heels to lift the barbell off the ground, extending your hips and knees.
4. As you stand up straight, squeeze your glutes and keep your core engaged.
5. Lower the barbell back down to the ground by bending at the hips and knees, keeping your back straight.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Set up with the bar over your mid-foot, shins about one inch from the bar, and pull the slack out of the bar before lifting by engaging your lats.
- Push the floor away with your feet rather than thinking about pulling the bar up; this cue helps you drive with your legs first.
- Keep the bar dragging against your shins and thighs throughout the lift to maintain the most efficient bar path.

## Common mistakes

- Rounding the lower back during the pull, which puts the lumbar discs at risk under heavy load.
- Starting with the hips too high (stiff-leg position) or too low (squat position); your hips should be between your shoulders and knees.
- Jerking the bar off the floor instead of building tension gradually and then driving smoothly.
