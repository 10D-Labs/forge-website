## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height and position yourself on the machine.
2. Place your upper arms on the pad and grip the handles with an underhand grip.
3. Keep your back straight and your elbows positioned on the pad.
4. Exhale and curl your forearms towards your upper arms, contracting your biceps.
5. Pause for a moment at the top of the movement, squeezing your biceps.
6. Inhale and slowly lower the handles back to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Adjust the seat so your armpits rest comfortably at the top of the pad and your elbows are firmly positioned on the surface.
- Curl the weight up by contracting the biceps, stopping just before the forearms are vertical to maintain tension.
- Lower the weight slowly (3-4 seconds) and avoid fully locking out at the bottom to protect the elbow tendons.

## Common mistakes

- Setting the seat too low so the shoulders hunch up, which strains the neck and reduces bicep isolation.
- Lifting the elbows off the pad at the top of the curl to gain extra range of motion (this uses the shoulders).
- Dropping the weight quickly at the bottom and hyperextending the elbows, which risks tendon strain.
