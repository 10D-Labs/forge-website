## How to perform

1. Stand facing a wall with your feet hip-width apart.
2. Place your hands against the wall at shoulder height.
3. Step back with one foot, keeping your heel on the ground and your leg straight.
4. Bend your front knee slightly and lean forward, feeling a stretch in your calf.
5. Hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds.
6. Switch legs and repeat the stretch.

## Pro tips

- Press into the wall with both hands and drive the back heel firmly into the ground for maximum calf stretch.
- Experiment with the distance between your back foot and the wall to find the position that gives the deepest comfortable stretch.
- Keep your hips square to the wall and avoid rotating your torso to one side.

## Common mistakes

- Placing the back foot too close to the wall, which does not create enough stretch on the calf.
- Bending the back knee, which reduces the gastrocnemius stretch and shifts it to the soleus.
- Pushing too hard into the wall with the arms instead of using the body weight to lean forward and stretch the calf.
