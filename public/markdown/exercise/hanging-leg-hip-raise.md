## How to perform

1. Hang from a pullup bar with your arms fully extended and your palms facing away from you.
2. Engage your core and lift your legs up by flexing your hips and knees until your thighs are parallel to the ground.
3. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Start from a dead hang and lift your thighs to at least parallel by flexing at the hips.
- At the top, tilt your pelvis upward (posterior tilt) to engage the lower abs beyond what hip flexors alone provide.
- Lower your legs under control for a 3-second eccentric to maximize core time under tension.

## Common mistakes

- Only lifting the knees without tilting the pelvis, which works the hip flexors but not the abs effectively.
- Using momentum to swing the legs up, which reduces abdominal activation.
- Losing grip strength before the abs are fatigued; use straps if grip is the limiting factor.

## FAQ

### What is the difference between a leg raise and a leg hip raise?

The hip raise adds a Pelvic Tilt at the top of the movement, which curls the pelvis upward and activates the lower abs. A standard leg raise can be done entirely with hip flexors.

They're one of the best exercises for the lower portion of the rectus abdominis because the Pelvic Tilt component directly targets that area.

### How many reps should I aim for?

Start with sets of 6-10 controlled reps. If you can do 15+ reps with good form, add ankle weights or hold a dumbbell between your feet.

### What muscles does the Hanging Leg Hip Raise work?

The Hanging Leg Hip Raise primarily targets the abs, with secondary activation in the hip flexors, lower back. It's classified as a strength exercise for the core.

### Is the Hanging Leg Hip Raise good for beginners?

The Hanging Leg Hip Raise is rated as intermediate. Beginners should build a base of abs strength with easier variations first.
