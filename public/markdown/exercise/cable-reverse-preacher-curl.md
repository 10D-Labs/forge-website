## How to perform

1. Adjust the cable machine so that the preacher curl pad is at chest height.
2. Sit on the preacher curl bench and place your upper arms on the pad, with your palms facing down and your elbows fully extended.
3. Grab the cable handles with an underhand grip, shoulder-width apart.
4. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the handles towards your shoulders, contracting your biceps.
5. Pause for a moment at the top of the movement, squeezing your biceps.
6. Inhale and slowly lower the handles back to the starting position, fully extending your elbows.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use a pronated (overhand) grip with your palms facing down. This shifts the load from the biceps to the brachioradialis and forearm extensors.
- Use lighter weight than regular Preacher Curls since the brachioradialis is smaller than the biceps. Form is more important than load here.
- Control the eccentric phase for 3 seconds to maximize forearm muscle activation and reduce elbow stress.

## Common mistakes

- Using the same weight as regular Preacher Curls, which forces compensation patterns and wrist strain.
- Flexing the wrists upward during the curl, which places excessive stress on the wrist extensors and can cause tendonitis.
- Lifting the elbows off the pad to assist with the curl, reducing the isolation of the brachioradialis.
