## How to perform

1. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly turned out.
2. Hold the barbell in front of your shoulders, resting it on your collarbone and shoulders.
3. Engage your core and keep your chest up as you lower your body down into a squat position, pushing your hips back and bending your knees.
4. Lower until your thighs are parallel to the ground, or as low as you can comfortably go.
5. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push through your heels to return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep two or three fingers under the bar with elbows pushed high; you don't need a full grip as long as the bar sits on your front delts.
- Brace your core as if someone is about to punch you in the stomach before each rep to maintain torso rigidity.
- Focus on sitting straight down between your hips rather than pushing your hips back like a back squat.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the elbows drop during the ascent, causing the bar to roll forward and the torso to collapse.
- Rising hips-first out of the bottom, which turns the front squat into a good morning with the bar on your shoulders.
- Not going deep enough because the upright position is uncomfortable; work on ankle and thoracic mobility.
