## How to perform

1. Start by lying flat on your back on a mat or bench.
2. Extend your arms straight out to the sides, perpendicular to your body.
3. Engage your core and lift both legs off the ground, keeping them together and straight.
4. Slowly lower your legs to one side, aiming to touch the ground with your feet while maintaining control.
5. Pause for a moment, then use your core to lift your legs back to the starting position.
6. Repeat the movement, this time lowering your legs to the opposite side.
7. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Press your arms firmly into the ground to create a stable base, and use your obliques to control the leg rotation.
- Keep your legs glued together and as straight as possible to maintain a long lever and maximum oblique engagement.
- Only lower your legs as far as you can control. If your opposite shoulder lifts off the ground, you've gone too far.

## Common mistakes

- Letting gravity take the legs to the floor instead of controlling the descent with the obliques.
- Bending the knees to make it easier, which reduces the lever arm and training stimulus.
- Rushing through the reps instead of pausing at each side for 1-2 seconds.
