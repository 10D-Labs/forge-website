## How to perform

1. Lie on your side with your legs straight and stacked on top of each other.
2. Place your bottom arm under your head for support.
3. Engage your adductors and lift your top leg as high as possible without rotating your hips or leaning backward.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your leg back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch sides.

## Pro tips

- Lift the bottom leg (not the top) by squeezing your inner thigh while the top leg stays stacked or placed in front for stability.
- Move slowly and hold the top position for 2 seconds to maximize adductor activation.
- Keep your body in a straight line and avoid rolling forward or backward during the lift.

## Common mistakes

- Lifting the top leg instead of the bottom leg, which works the abductors instead of the adductors.
- Using momentum to swing the leg up instead of lifting with a controlled contraction.
- Rolling the body backward to get the leg higher instead of isolating the inner thigh muscles.
