## How to perform

1. Attach a weight to one end of a rope or bar.
2. Hold the other end of the rope or bar with both hands, palms facing down.
3. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your arms fully extended in front of you.
4. Slowly roll the weight up towards your hands by flexing your wrists.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the weight back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your arms extended straight out in front of you at shoulder height for maximum forearm engagement.
- Roll the weight up slowly with deliberate wrist flexion, alternating hands, rather than spinning it fast.
- Perform both rolling up (flexion) and rolling down (extension) to train both forearm muscle groups.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the arms drop below shoulder height as fatigue sets in, which reduces the difficulty and forearm activation.
- Rolling the weight too quickly, using momentum instead of controlled wrist movements.
- Only rolling in one direction and neglecting the reverse direction, which creates forearm muscle imbalances.
