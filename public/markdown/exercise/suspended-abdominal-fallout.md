## How to perform

1. Attach a suspension trainer to a high anchor point and adjust the straps to waist height.
2. Stand facing away from the anchor point and hold the handles with your arms extended in front of you.
3. Lean forward at the waist, keeping your body straight and your core engaged.
4. Lower your body as far as you can while maintaining control and tension in your abs.
5. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then slowly raise your body back up to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Start with the straps at mid-length and only lean forward as far as you can while keeping your lower back flat.
- Keep your arms straight and let the movement happen at the shoulders, not the elbows.
- Squeeze your abs hard to pull yourself back to the starting position rather than pulling with your arms.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the lower back arch as you fall forward, which compresses the lumbar spine under load.
- Bending the elbows during the fallout, which shortens the lever arm and makes the exercise easier but less effective.
- Using straps that are too long, which makes the exercise too difficult and compromises form.
