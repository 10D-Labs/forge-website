## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet hip-width apart and place your hands on a wall or sturdy object for balance.
2. Lift one foot off the ground and balance on the other foot.
3. Slowly raise your heel off the ground, lifting your body up onto the ball of your foot.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your heel back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch legs and repeat.

## Pro tips

- Hold onto a wall or rack with your fingertips (not your full palm) to maintain balance without relying on your arms for support.
- Rise as high as possible on the ball of your foot, hold for 1 second, then lower slowly for 3 seconds.
- Perform on a step or raised surface if available to add range of motion at the bottom.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning heavily on the wall or support surface, which offloads weight from the working calf.
- Allowing the ankle to roll outward (supinate) during the raise, which stresses the ankle ligaments.
- Not lowering the heel back to the floor between reps, performing only the top portion of the range.
