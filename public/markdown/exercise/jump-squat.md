## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Lower your body into a squat position by bending your knees and pushing your hips back.
3. Jump explosively off the ground, extending your hips, knees, and ankles.
4. While in mid-air, quickly bring your arms forward for balance.
5. Land softly on the balls of your feet and immediately go into the next repetition.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Squat to at least parallel before exploding upward. A shallow squat produces less power and reduces training effect.
- Land softly on the balls of your feet and immediately sink into the next squat to absorb force and maintain rhythm.
- Swing your arms forward and up as you jump to generate additional upward momentum.

## Common mistakes

- Landing with stiff, straight legs, which sends shock through the knees and spine instead of being absorbed by the muscles.
- Not squatting deep enough before the jump, which limits power output and muscle recruitment.
- Letting the knees cave inward on landing, which stresses the ACL and meniscus.

## FAQ

### Are Jump Squats bad for your knees?

Not inherently. They're safe when you land softly, keep your knees tracking over your toes, and squat to appropriate depth. Avoid them if you have existing knee injuries or can't perform a proper Bodyweight Squat first.

### How many Jump Squats should I do per set?

For power development, 5-8 reps per set with full recovery between sets. For conditioning, 10-15 reps per set. Quality of each jump matters more than total volume.

### Should I add weight to Jump Squats?

Bodyweight is sufficient for most people. If you do add weight, use no more than 20-30% of your back squat max held in a goblet position. Too much weight reduces jump height and increases injury risk.

### What muscles does the Jump Squat work?

The Jump Squat primarily targets the glutes, with secondary activation in the quadriceps, hamstrings, calves. It's classified as a plyometrics exercise for the legs.

### Is the Jump Squat good for beginners?

The Jump Squat is rated as intermediate. Beginners should build a base of glutes strength with easier variations first.
