## How to perform

1. Lie flat on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground.
2. Place your hands behind your head with your elbows pointing outwards.
3. Engaging your abs, lift your upper body off the ground, curling forward until your torso is at a 45 degree angle.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your upper body back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Place the soles of your feet together in a butterfly position to take the hip flexors out of the movement and isolate the abs.
- Curl your shoulders off the floor by contracting your abs, not by pulling on your neck.
- Exhale forcefully at the top of each crunch to fully contract the rectus abdominis.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling on the head and neck with the hands, which causes neck strain and reduces the ab training effect.
- Using the hip flexors to assist the crunch instead of keeping the soles of the feet together to deactivate them.
- Performing the movement too fast, using momentum instead of controlled ab contraction.
