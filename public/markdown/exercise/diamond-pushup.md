## How to perform

1. Start in a high plank position with your hands close together, forming a diamond shape with your thumbs and index fingers.
2. Keep your body in a straight line from head to toe, engaging your core and glutes.
3. Lower your chest towards the diamond shape formed by your hands, keeping your elbows close to your body.
4. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push yourself back up to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Form a diamond shape with your thumbs and index fingers touching directly under your chest. This hand position maximizes tricep engagement.
- Keep your elbows tucked close to your body (pointing backward, not outward) as you lower your chest to your hands.
- Lower slowly until your chest touches the diamond, then press up with an explosive push. If you cannot reach full depth, start with an easier variation.

## Common mistakes

- Placing the hands too far forward (under the face instead of the chest), which puts excessive stress on the wrists and shoulders.
- Flaring the elbows outward, which shifts the load from the triceps to the chest and can strain the shoulders.
- Sagging the hips due to core weakness, which reduces the exercise to a partial range of motion.
