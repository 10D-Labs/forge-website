## How to perform

1. Start in a high plank position with your hands placed close together, directly under your shoulders.
2. Engage your core and lower your body towards the ground, keeping your elbows close to your sides.
3. Push through your palms to extend your arms and return to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Place your hands directly under your shoulders or slightly narrower with your index fingers and thumbs close together. This narrow hand position shifts the load to the triceps.
- Keep your elbows tucked close to your ribs as you lower, pointing them backward rather than flaring out to the sides.
- Lower until your chest nearly touches your hands, then press up explosively while keeping your core braced and body in a straight line.

## Common mistakes

- Flaring the elbows out to the sides, which shifts emphasis to the chest and shoulders and away from the triceps.
- Sagging the hips, which indicates weak core engagement and reduces tricep loading.
- Not going deep enough to fully stretch the triceps at the bottom of the rep.
