## How to perform

1. Lie flat on your back with your legs extended and your hands by your sides.
2. Engage your core and lift your legs off the ground about 6 inches.
3. Keeping your legs straight, alternate lifting one leg slightly higher than the other.
4. Continue this fluttering motion for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Press your lower back flat into the floor and place your hands under your glutes for support to protect your lumbar spine.
- Keep the kicking range small (6-12 inches) and fast to maintain constant tension on the hip flexors and lower abs.
- Point your toes to engage the quads and create a longer lever for more difficulty.

## Common mistakes

- Allowing the lower back to arch off the floor, which causes lumbar strain instead of working the core and glutes.
- Lifting the legs too high, which reduces tension on the target muscles and makes the exercise easier.
- Holding the breath instead of breathing steadily, which increases blood pressure and reduces endurance.
