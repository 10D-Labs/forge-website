## How to perform

1. Start by kneeling on the ground with your knees hip-width apart.
2. Place your hands on the ground in front of you for support.
3. Slowly lean forward, shifting your weight onto your hands and extending your legs behind you.
4. Keep your back straight and engage your glutes as you push your hips back and up towards the ceiling.
5. Hold this position for a few seconds, feeling a stretch in your glutes.
6. Slowly return to the starting position by bending your knees and lowering your hips back down.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Spread your knees wide and point your toes outward to open the hips and target the inner groin area.
- Rock forward and backward gently, using your hands for support, to progressively deepen the stretch.
- Keep your lower back in a neutral position; avoid arching or rounding as you rock.

## Common mistakes

- Positioning the knees too narrow, which turns it into a general quad stretch instead of targeting the hip adductors and glutes.
- Rocking too aggressively, which can strain the inner groin muscles.
- Holding the breath during the stretch instead of breathing deeply to allow the muscles to relax and lengthen.
