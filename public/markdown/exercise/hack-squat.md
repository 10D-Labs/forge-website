## How to perform

1. Adjust the leg press machine to a comfortable position for your height.
2. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart on the platform, toes slightly pointed outwards.
3. Hold onto the handles or bars for stability.
4. Lower your body by bending your knees and hips, keeping your back straight and chest up.
5. Continue lowering until your thighs are parallel to the ground or slightly below.
6. Pause for a moment, then push through your heels to raise your body back up to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Position your feet shoulder-width apart on the platform with toes slightly turned out for natural knee tracking.
- Keep your back flat against the pad the entire time; if it lifts, you're going too deep for your mobility.
- Drive through the heels and midfoot, not the toes, to maximize quad and glute engagement.

## Common mistakes

- Loading too much weight and only achieving a quarter squat, missing the most effective range of motion.
- Letting the knees cave inward at the bottom of the squat, which stresses the ACL and meniscus.
- Locking the knees aggressively at the top, which can hyperextend the joint under heavy loads.

## FAQ

### Is the Hack Squat a good exercise for quads?

It's one of the best. The fixed back position and angled platform isolate the quads while reducing lower back demand. Many bodybuilders consider it a staple for quad development.

### How does the Hack Squat compare to the barbell squat?

The Hack Squat isolates the legs more by removing the balance and core stability demands of a barbell squat. It's safer for going heavy on leg-specific work but doesn't build the same functional strength.

### Should my knees go past my toes on the Hack Squat?

Some forward knee travel is normal and safe, especially if you have good ankle mobility. The machine supports your back, so moderate knee travel is not harmful. Just keep your heels down.

### What muscles does the Hack Squat work?

The Hack Squat primarily targets the glutes, with secondary activation in the quadriceps, hamstrings, calves. It's classified as a strength exercise for the legs.

### Is the Hack Squat good for beginners?

The Hack Squat is rated as intermediate. Beginners should build a base of glutes strength with easier variations first.
