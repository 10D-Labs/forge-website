2. Hold the cable handle with your right hand, palm facing down, and position your arm so that it is fully extended and parallel to the ground.
3. Keep your elbow stationary and close to your body.
4. Slowly bend your elbow, lowering the cable handle towards the back of your head.

6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch sides and perform the exercise with your left arm.

## Pro tips

- Face away from the machine with the cable behind your head. Extend your arm forward and upward until it is fully locked out, squeezing the tricep at the top.
- Keep your upper arm angled slightly forward and stationary. Only your forearm should move at the elbow joint.
- Use your free hand to stabilize your working elbow to prevent it from drifting during the extension.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the elbow flare out to the side, which reduces the range of motion and Tricep Stretch.
- Moving the entire arm instead of isolating the movement at the elbow joint, which brings the shoulder into play.
- Using too much weight and arching the back to push through the extension.
