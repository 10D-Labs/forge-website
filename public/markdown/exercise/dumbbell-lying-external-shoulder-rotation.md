## How to perform

1. Lie on your side on a flat bench with your upper arm against your side and your elbow bent 90 degrees.
2. Hold a dumbbell in your hand with your palm facing down.
3. Keeping your upper arm against your side, slowly rotate your forearm upward as far as possible.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your forearm back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch sides.

## Pro tips

- Keep your upper arm pinned against your side with your elbow at exactly 90 degrees throughout the entire movement.
- Use a very light dumbbell (2-5 lbs) since the rotator cuff muscles are small and fatigue quickly.
- Rotate slowly through the full range of motion, pausing at the top for 1-2 seconds.

## Common mistakes

- Using too much weight, which causes the larger shoulder muscles to compensate and defeats the purpose of rotator cuff isolation.
- Lifting the elbow away from the side during the rotation, which recruits the deltoid instead of the infraspinatus.
- Rushing through reps without controlling the eccentric portion of the movement.

## FAQ

### Why is external rotation important for shoulder health?

A bench is ideal because it allows your forearm to drop below the level of your body for a fuller range of motion. The floor limits the downward range.
