## How to perform

1. Hang from the parallel bars with your arms fully extended and your body straight.
2. Engage your core and lift your knees up in front of you.
3. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lock your arms straight and depress your shoulders to create a stable base before lifting your knees.
- Curl your pelvis upward at the top of the movement to fully engage the lower abs rather than just the hip flexors.
- Control the lowering phase for at least 2 seconds to maximize abdominal tension.

## Common mistakes

- Swinging the legs using momentum instead of controlling the movement with the abs.
- Letting the shoulders shrug up toward the ears, which destabilizes the upper body and reduces core engagement.
- Stopping the knees at hip height without the Pelvic Tilt, which works primarily the hip flexors instead of the abs.
