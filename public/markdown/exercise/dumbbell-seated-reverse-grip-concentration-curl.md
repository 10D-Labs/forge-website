## How to perform

2. Rest your elbow on the inside of your thigh, just above the knee.
3. Keeping your upper arm stationary, exhale and curl the dumbbell towards your shoulder.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, squeezing your biceps.
5. Inhale and slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch arms.

## Pro tips

- Brace your elbow against your inner thigh and curl the dumbbell toward your shoulder with your palm facing up.
- Turn your head to watch the working arm so you can focus on the mind-muscle connection with the bicep.
- Lower the dumbbell slowly, resisting gravity, to maximize the eccentric loading on the bicep.

## Common mistakes

- Moving the elbow off the thigh during the curl, which allows the shoulder to assist and reduces isolation.
- Swinging the torso to generate momentum on the curl rather than using pure bicep contraction.
- Not fully extending the arm at the bottom, cutting the range of motion short.
