## How to perform

1. Lie flat on your back with your legs extended and your arms by your sides.
2. Place your hands under your glutes for support.
3. Engage your abs and lift both legs off the ground, keeping them straight.
4. As you lift your legs, twist your hips to one side, bringing your legs towards your opposite shoulder.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat the movement, this time twisting your hips to the other side.
7. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your lower back pressed into the floor by engaging your deep core muscles before lifting your legs.
- Twist from the hips, not the knees, to ensure the obliques are doing the rotational work.
- Lower your legs slowly on each side; the controlled eccentric is where the obliques work hardest.

## Common mistakes

- Arching the lower back off the floor as the legs lower, which puts dangerous stress on the lumbar spine.
- Using momentum to swing the legs from side to side instead of controlling the rotation with the obliques.
- Bending the knees during the raise, which shortens the lever arm and reduces the difficulty and ab engagement.
