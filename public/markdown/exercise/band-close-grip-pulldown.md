1. Attach the band to a high anchor point, such as a pullup bar or sturdy beam.
2. Stand facing the anchor point and grab the band with an underhand grip, hands shoulder-width apart.
3. Step back to create tension in the band, keeping your feet hip-width apart.
4. Engage your core and keep your back straight as you pull the band down towards your chest, squeezing your shoulder blades together.
5. Pause for a moment at the bottom of the movement, then slowly release the band back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Pull the band down to your upper chest while keeping your elbows tight to your body.
- Lean back slightly and focus on driving the elbows down and behind you to maximally engage the lats.
- Control the release back to the top for a 2-3 second count to maintain tension.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling with the biceps instead of initiating the movement by depressing the shoulder blades.
- Leaning too far back, which turns it into a row rather than a pulldown.
- Using a band that is too light, making it impossible to get sufficient resistance for muscle growth.
