## How to perform

1. Stand with your toes on an elevated surface, such as a step or block.
2. Place your hands on a stable support, such as a wall or railing, for balance.
3. Raise your heels as high as possible, lifting your body weight onto the balls of your feet.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your heels back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Stand with your toes on a raised surface and lean forward at the hips so your torso is roughly parallel to the ground. This hip-flexed position provides a greater calf stretch than Standing Calf Raises.
- Lower your heels as far below the step as possible to get a deep stretch in the calves, then rise onto your toes as high as possible.
- Pause at both the top (full contraction) and bottom (full stretch) of each rep for 2 seconds to maximize calf fiber recruitment.

## Common mistakes

- Not going through the full range of motion, doing partial reps at the top without fully stretching the calves at the bottom.
- Bouncing at the bottom of each rep, which uses the Achilles tendon elasticity instead of the calf muscles.
- Bending the knees during the raise, which shifts the load from the gastrocnemius to the soleus.
