## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a barbell in one hand with an overhand grip.
2. Keep your back straight and your core engaged.
3. Bend at the hips and lower the barbell towards the outside of your leg, keeping your arm straight and your chest up.
4. Lower the barbell as far as you can while maintaining good form.
5. Pause for a moment, then slowly return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch sides.

## Pro tips

- Hold the bar at your side like a suitcase and keep your torso as upright as possible to resist lateral flexion.
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout and initiate the lift by driving through your heels and extending your hips.
- Engage your obliques on the opposite side to keep your torso from tilting toward the bar.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning heavily toward the bar side, which turns it into a side bend rather than a Deadlift.
- Rounding the back because the asymmetric loading makes it harder to maintain posture.
- Gripping the bar off-center, causing it to tilt and create an uneven load.
