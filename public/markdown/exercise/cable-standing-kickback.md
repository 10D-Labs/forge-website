## How to perform

1. Attach a cable to a low pulley and stand facing away from the machine.
2. Place the cable around your ankle and stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
3. Keep your core engaged and your back straight throughout the exercise.
4. Slowly extend your leg straight back, squeezing your glutes at the top of the movement.
5. Pause for a moment, then return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
7. Switch sides and repeat with the other leg.

## Pro tips

- Attach the ankle cuff low and face the machine. Kick your leg straight back by squeezing your glute, not by arching your lower back.
- Lean your torso forward slightly and hold the machine frame with both hands for stability. This allows a greater range of hip extension.
- Pause at the top of the kickback for a full second and squeeze the glute before slowly lowering back down.

## Common mistakes

- Arching the lower back to kick the leg higher, which stresses the lumbar spine and takes tension off the glutes.
- Bending the knee excessively during the kickback, which recruits the hamstrings more than the glutes.
- Swinging the leg with momentum rather than using a controlled glute contraction.
