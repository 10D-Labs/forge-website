- Lower the weight until your arms are fully extended to get a complete lat stretch between reps.

## Common mistakes

- Gripping too wide on the handles, which reduces the mechanical advantage of the reverse grip.
- Shrugging the shoulders up during the pull instead of keeping them depressed and retracted.
- Using momentum by bouncing the chest off the pad with each rep.
