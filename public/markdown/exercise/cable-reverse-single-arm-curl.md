## How to perform

1. Stand facing a cable machine with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Grasp the cable handle with an underhand grip, palm facing down.
3. Keep your elbow close to your side and slowly curl your forearm up towards your shoulder.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your forearm back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your palm facing down (pronated grip) throughout the entire curl to target the brachioradialis and forearm extensors.
- Pin your elbow to your side and curl only with the forearm, eliminating any shoulder movement.
- Use a slow, controlled tempo since the brachioradialis is a smaller muscle that fatigues quickly with sloppy form.

## Common mistakes

- Rotating the wrist to a supinated (palm up) position during the curl, which turns it into a standard biceps curl.
- Swinging the elbow forward to help lift the weight instead of keeping it locked at the side.
- Using too much weight and compensating with body lean or shoulder momentum.

The cable provides constant tension throughout the entire range of motion, including at the top where a dumbbell reverse curl loses tension.

The pronated grip places the biceps in a mechanically disadvantaged position, forcing the brachioradialis and forearm muscles to handle more of the load.
