## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing your thighs.
2. Keeping your arms straight, exhale and lift the dumbbells in front of you until they are at shoulder level.
3. Pause for a moment at the top, then inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Stop the dumbbells at shoulder height rather than swinging them overhead to keep constant tension on the anterior deltoid.
- Use a slight bend in the elbows and keep the angle locked throughout the movement.
- Control the descent for 2-3 seconds to maximize the eccentric loading on the front delts.

## Common mistakes

- Using too much weight and swinging the dumbbells up with body momentum, reducing shoulder activation.
- Shrugging the shoulders up as you raise the weight, which recruits the traps instead of isolating the front delts.
- Hyperextending the lower back to assist with lifting the weight overhead.
