## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly turned out.
2. Hold the kettlebell with both hands in front of your chest, close to your body.
3. Engage your core and keep your chest up as you lower your hips down and back, as if sitting into a chair.
4. Lower until your thighs are parallel to the ground, or as low as you can comfortably go.
5. Drive through your heels to stand back up, squeezing your glutes at the top.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hold the kettlebell in the goblet position (both hands on the horns) or in a double rack position with elbows tight to your body.
- Keep your elbows up and chest tall throughout the squat to prevent the weight from pulling you forward.
- Push your knees out over your toes and sit your hips down between your feet, not behind them.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the elbows drop and the chest cave forward, which shifts the load onto the lower back.
- Rising on the toes at the bottom of the squat, indicating limited ankle mobility. Place small plates under your heels if needed.
- Not squatting to parallel depth, which limits glute and quad development.
