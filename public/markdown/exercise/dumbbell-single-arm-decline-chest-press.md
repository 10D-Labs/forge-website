2. Place your feet flat on the ground and keep your back pressed against the bench.
3. Extend your arm and push the dumbbell up towards the ceiling, fully extending your elbow.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbell back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch to the other arm.

## Pro tips

- Lock your feet securely under the foot pads before unracking the dumbbell to prevent sliding.
- Press at a slight inward angle toward your sternum to follow the natural fiber direction of the lower chest.
- Lower the dumbbell until your elbow is just below bench level, then drive back up through the heel of your palm.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the dumbbell drift too far toward the head, which turns it into a flat press angle and reduces lower chest activation.
- Arching the lower back excessively, which defeats the purpose of the decline angle.
- Forgetting to brace the core, causing the torso to rotate under the unilateral load.
