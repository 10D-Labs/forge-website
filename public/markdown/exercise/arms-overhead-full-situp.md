## How to perform

1. Lie flat on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground.
2. Extend your arms overhead, keeping them straight.
3. Engaging your abs, slowly lift your upper body off the ground, curling forward until your torso is upright.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your upper body back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Extend your arms straight overhead throughout the entire sit-up to create the longest possible lever arm.
- Engage your abs first, then curl up sequentially: head, shoulders, upper back, then lower back leaving the floor.
- Lower yourself back down vertebra by vertebra rather than dropping flat.

## Common mistakes

- Bending the arms during the ascent, which shortens the lever arm and makes the exercise easier.
- Using momentum by throwing the arms forward to help sit up, which bypasses the ab work.
- Anchoring the feet under something heavy, which lets the hip flexors dominate the movement.
