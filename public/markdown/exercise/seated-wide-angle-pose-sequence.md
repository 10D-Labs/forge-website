## How to perform

1. Sit on the ground with your legs extended in a wide angle.
2. Flex your feet and engage your quadriceps.
3. Place your hands on the ground behind you for support.
4. Keeping your back straight, lean forward from your hips.
5. Continue leaning forward until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings.
6. Hold this position for a few breaths.
7. Slowly release the stretch and return to the starting position.
8. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Flex your feet strongly and press through your heels to activate the quads, which helps the hamstrings relax via reciprocal inhibition.
- Walk your hands forward slowly and let gravity help deepen the fold rather than pulling yourself down.
- Rotate your thighs slightly outward to tilt your pelvis forward, which creates a better angle for the Hamstring Stretch.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the feet and toes point inward, which internally rotates the hips and limits the stretch.
- Rounding the spine aggressively to get the chest to the floor; a flat back with less depth is more effective.
- Spreading the legs too wide beyond your current flexibility, which strains the adductors.
