## How to perform

1. Stand facing the cable machine with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Grasp the cable handle with an underhand grip, palm facing up.
3. Keep your elbow close to your side and slowly curl your forearm up towards your shoulder.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your forearm back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Stand directly in front of the low pulley so the cable pulls straight down, maximizing tension at every point of the curl arc.
- Squeeze your bicep hard at the top and lower the weight for a full 2-3 seconds to maximize time under tension.
- Keep your wrist neutral and straight. Do not flex or extend your wrist, which reduces bicep engagement and strains the forearm.

## Common mistakes

- Swinging the elbow forward to lift more weight, which uses the front delt and shortens the effective range for the bicep.
- Standing too far from the cable, which angles the resistance and reduces the difficulty at the top of the curl.
- Curling too fast without controlling the eccentric, which wastes half the muscle-building potential of each rep.
