2. Lie flat on the bench with your feet firmly planted on the ground.
3. Grip the bar with an overhand grip slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
4. Unrack the bar and lower it towards your chest, keeping your elbows tucked in.
5. Pause for a moment when the bar touches your chest.
6. Push the bar back up to the starting position, fully extending your arms.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Position the bench so the bar path travels straight down to your mid-chest, not your neck or belly.
- Keep your shoulder blades squeezed together and your back slightly arched for a stable pressing position.
- Lower the bar to touch your chest on every rep for full range of motion.

## Common mistakes

- Positioning the bench too far forward or back relative to the bar path, causing the bar to track over the neck or stomach.
- Flattening the back completely against the bench instead of maintaining a slight natural arch.
- Bouncing the bar off the chest to generate momentum.
