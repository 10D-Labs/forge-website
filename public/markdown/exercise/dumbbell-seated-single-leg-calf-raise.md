## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench or chair with your feet flat on the ground and a dumbbell resting on your right thigh.
2. Extend your left leg straight out in front of you, keeping your foot flexed.
3. Place the ball of your right foot on an elevated surface, such as a step or weight plate.
4. Using your calf muscles, raise your right heel as high as possible.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your heel back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch legs.

## Pro tips

- Place the dumbbell on the thigh of the working leg, directly above the knee, for maximum resistance on the calf.
- Push through the ball of your foot and raise your heel as high as possible, squeezing the calf at the top for 1-2 seconds.
- Lower your heel below the step or plate at the bottom to get a full stretch on the calf muscle before each rep.

## Common mistakes

- Bouncing at the bottom instead of performing a controlled stretch and contraction on each rep.
- Placing the dumbbell too far forward on the thigh, which makes it unstable and reduces the loading on the calf.
- Not using a full range of motion, particularly skipping the stretch at the bottom of the movement.
