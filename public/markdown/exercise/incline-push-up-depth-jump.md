## How to perform

1. Find an elevated surface, such as a bench or step, and place your hands shoulder-width apart on the edge.
2. Step your feet back, keeping your body in a straight line from head to heels.
3. Lower your chest towards the edge of the surface, bending your elbows and keeping your body aligned.
4. Push through your palms to extend your arms and return to the starting position.
5. Jump off the edge of the surface, landing softly with your knees slightly bent.
6. Repeat the pushup and depth jump for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Push explosively off the elevated surface so your hands leave the edge, then land with soft elbows to absorb the impact.
- Keep your core braced throughout the plyometric phase to maintain body alignment during the jump.
- Start with a lower surface (6-12 inches) and gradually increase the height as your power improves.

## Common mistakes

- Landing with locked elbows, which transmits all the impact force through the wrists and shoulder joints.
- Not pushing hard enough to get meaningful air time, which reduces the plyometric training effect.
- Losing core tension during the jump, causing the hips to sag on landing.
