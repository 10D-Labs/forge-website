## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height so that your feet are flat on the ground and your knees are at a 90 degree angle.
2. Grasp the handles of the machine with your palms facing down and your arms fully extended.
3. Slowly lower your body by bending your elbows until your upper arms are parallel to the ground.
4. Pause for a moment, then push yourself back up to the starting position by straightening your arms.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your back close to the pad and avoid leaning forward to keep tension on the triceps rather than the chest.
- Lower until your upper arms are parallel to the floor but not deeper, as excessive depth shifts stress to the shoulder joint.
- Squeeze your triceps hard at the top of each rep and hold for a one-count before lowering again.

## Common mistakes

- Using momentum by bouncing out of the bottom position instead of pressing with controlled force.
- Setting the seat too low, which forces the shoulders into an impinged position at the bottom of the rep.
- Flaring the elbows out wide, which turns this into more of a chest exercise and reduces tricep activation.
