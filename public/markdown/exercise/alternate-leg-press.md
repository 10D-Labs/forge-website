## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat and foot platform of the machine to your desired position.
2. Sit on the machine with your back against the backrest and your feet on the foot platform.
3. Place your hands on the handles or sides of the machine for stability.
4. Push one foot against the foot platform, extending your leg until it is almost fully straight.
5. Pause for a moment, then slowly bend your leg and return to the starting position.
6. Repeat with the other leg.
7. Continue alternating legs for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Press through the full foot, emphasizing the heel, to keep the quad engaged and protect the knee.
- Keep the non-working leg stable on the platform; do not let it drift or relax between reps.
- Lower the weight until your working knee reaches about 90 degrees, then press back up without locking out.

## Common mistakes

- Pressing through the toes instead of the full foot, which puts excessive stress on the knee joint.
- Lowering too deep on one side, causing the hips to shift off the seat pad, which strains the lower back.
- Using significantly different ranges of motion on each leg, which reinforces existing imbalances rather than correcting them.
