## How to perform

1. Start by hanging from a pullup bar with your palms facing away from you and your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
2. Engage your core and pull your shoulder blades down and back.
3. Bend your elbows and pull your chest towards the bar, keeping your body straight.
4. Once your chest reaches the bar, push down with your hands and drive your elbows back, lifting your body above the bar.
5. Pause at the top of the movement, then slowly lower yourself back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use an aggressive hip kip to generate the momentum needed to clear the bar with the extra weight.
- Wear the weight low on your body (dip belt) to keep your center of gravity close to the bar during the transition.
- Pull explosively and aim to get your chest, not just your chin, above the bar before initiating the transition.

## Common mistakes

- Adding weight before mastering 8-10 clean bodyweight Muscle Ups, which leads to sloppy technique and injury.
- Using a chicken wing transition (one arm at a time) instead of bringing both arms over simultaneously.
- Neglecting the negative (lowering) phase, which is where a lot of the strength-building stimulus comes from.
