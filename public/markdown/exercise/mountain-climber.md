## How to perform

1. Start in a high plank position with your hands directly under your shoulders and your body in a straight line.
2. Engage your core and bring your right knee towards your chest, then quickly switch and bring your left knee towards your chest.
3. Continue alternating legs in a running motion, keeping your hips low and your core engaged.
4. Maintain a steady pace and breathe evenly throughout the exercise.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your hips at the same height as your shoulders; don't let them pike up or sag down.
- Drive each knee toward your chest explosively while keeping your hands planted directly under your shoulders.
- Land each foot softly under your hips rather than stomping; this reduces joint impact and maintains rhythm.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the hips rise into a pike position, which turns it into more of a hip flexor exercise than a full-body cardio movement.
- Bouncing the toes off the ground with short, choppy steps instead of fully driving the knees forward.
- Holding the breath instead of maintaining a steady breathing pattern.
