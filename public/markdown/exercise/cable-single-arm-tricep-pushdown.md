## How to perform

1. Stand facing a cable machine with a straight bar attachment at chest height.
2. Grasp the bar with an overhand grip and step back to create tension in the cable.
3. Position your feet shoulder-width apart and slightly bend your knees.
4. Keep your back straight and core engaged throughout the exercise.
5. Start with your arm fully extended and perpendicular to the floor.
6. Keeping your upper arm stationary, exhale and push the bar down until your arm is fully extended.
7. Pause for a moment, then inhale and slowly return to the starting position.
8. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch arms.

## Pro tips

- Keep your working elbow pinned to your side and only extend at the elbow joint; your upper arm should not move.
- Squeeze the tricep hard at full extension and hold for a one-count before letting the cable pull your forearm back up.
- Use your free hand to hold onto the machine or your hip for stability.

## Common mistakes

- Pushing down with the entire body by leaning over the cable, which turns it into a pressing motion.
- Letting the elbow drift forward during the extension, which recruits the shoulder.
- Using too much weight and compensating with body lean instead of pure Tricep Extension.

## FAQ

### Why do single-arm pushdowns instead of both arms?

Single-arm work isolates each tricep independently, preventing your stronger arm from dominating. It also lets you focus entirely on the mind-muscle connection of one tricep at a time.

### What handle should I use?

A single D-handle or rope end works well. The D-handle allows a neutral or pronated grip; the rope allows a more natural wrist position.

### Where should the cable be set?

Set the pulley at chest to head height. This gives you enough range of motion to fully extend the arm without the weight stack bottoming out.

### What muscles does the Cable Single Arm Tricep Pushdown work?

The Cable Single Arm Tricep Pushdown primarily targets the triceps, with secondary activation in the forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.

Yes, the Cable Single Arm Tricep Pushdown is rated as a beginner-level exercise. It's a great starting point for building triceps strength.
