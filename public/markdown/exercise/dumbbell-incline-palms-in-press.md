## Pro tips

- Keep your palms facing each other throughout the entire press to shift emphasis toward the inner chest fibers and reduce shoulder strain.
- Drive the dumbbells together slightly at the top of each rep to maximize the chest squeeze with the neutral grip.
- Plant your feet firmly and maintain a slight arch in your lower back to create a stable pressing foundation on the incline.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the elbows flare out wide, which defeats the purpose of the neutral grip and increases shoulder joint stress.
- Setting the bench too steep (above 45 degrees), which turns this into more of a shoulder press than a chest exercise.
- Rotating the wrists during the press so palms end up facing forward, losing the neutral grip benefit.
