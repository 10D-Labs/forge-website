## How to perform

1. Sit on a preacher bench with your chest against the pad and your arm extended over the edge of the bench, holding a dumbbell with an underhand grip.
2. Lower the dumbbell slowly until your arm is fully extended.
3. Curl the dumbbell back up towards your shoulder, keeping your upper arm stationary.
4. Squeeze your biceps at the top of the movement, then slowly lower the dumbbell back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch arms.

## Pro tips

- Keep your palm facing down (pronated) throughout the curl to target the brachioradialis and brachialis.
- Press the back of your upper arm firmly into the preacher pad to eliminate any body English.
- Lower the weight slowly for a 3-second eccentric to maximize brachioradialis activation.

## Common mistakes

- Supinating the wrist during the curl, which shifts the load to the biceps brachii and defeats the reverse grip purpose.
- Lifting the elbow off the pad at the bottom of the movement to cheat the weight up.
- Using the same weight as a standard Preacher Curl, when the reverse grip requires significantly less load.

The pad eliminates momentum and shoulder movement, providing strict isolation. This makes the exercise harder but more effective for targeting the intended muscles.
