## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height and chest pad position according to your comfort.
2. Sit on the machine with your back against the chest pad and your feet flat on the floor.
3. Grasp the handles or side bars for stability.
4. Engage your abs and slowly lean back, allowing the chest pad to move with you.
5. Pause for a moment at the maximum contraction, feeling the tension in your abs.
6. Slowly return to the starting position by contracting your abs and pulling yourself back up.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Exhale forcefully at the bottom of the crunch to maximize abdominal contraction.
- Keep your lower back pressed against the pad throughout the movement to isolate the abs.
- Focus on curling your ribcage toward your pelvis rather than simply bending at the hips.

## Common mistakes

- Using momentum or swinging the upper body forward instead of controlling the movement with the abs.
- Setting the weight too heavy and compensating with hip flexors rather than abdominal muscles.
- Pulling on the handles with the arms instead of letting the core do the work.
