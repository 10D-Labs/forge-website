## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height and position yourself on the machine with your knees resting on the pads and your upper body facing forward.
2. Grasp the handles or the sides of the machine for stability.
3. Keeping your core engaged, twist your torso to one side as far as comfortably possible.
4. Pause for a moment, then slowly return to the starting position.
5. Repeat the twist to the opposite side.
6. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Rotate from the thoracic spine (mid-back), not the lumbar spine. Your hips should stay relatively fixed while your upper body twists.
- Use a controlled tempo. Twist to one side for 2 seconds, hold for 1 second, return for 2 seconds.
- Keep your abs braced throughout the entire set, not just during the twist.

## Common mistakes

- Twisting from the lower back instead of the mid-back, which can strain the lumbar spine.
- Using momentum to swing from side to side rather than controlling the rotation with the obliques.
- Gripping the handles too tightly, which tenses the upper body and reduces the focus on the core.
