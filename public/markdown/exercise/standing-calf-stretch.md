## How to perform

1. Stand facing a wall or sturdy object, about an arm's length away.
2. Place your hands on the wall or object at shoulder height.
3. Step back with one foot, keeping your heel flat on the ground.
4. Bend your front knee slightly and lean forward, keeping your back leg straight.
5. You should feel a stretch in your calf muscle.
6. Hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds.
7. Repeat on the other leg.

## Pro tips

- Step far enough back that you feel a strong pull in the calf without your heel lifting off the floor.
- Keep the back foot pointing straight ahead (not turned outward) for a direct gastrocnemius stretch.
- Lean your hips forward, not just your upper body, to deepen the stretch at the ankle.

## Common mistakes

- Turning the back foot outward, which rotates the stretch away from the calf and toward the inner ankle.
- Lifting the back heel off the floor, which eliminates the calf stretch entirely.
- Leaning only from the waist instead of shifting the entire body forward from the ankle.
