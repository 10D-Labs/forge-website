## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing your torso and arms extended straight down.
2. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps.
3. Continue to raise the dumbbells until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level.
4. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
5. Inhale and slowly begin to lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Sit upright with your arms hanging straight down at your sides, palms facing your torso, before beginning the curl.
- Curl without rotating your wrists; the neutral grip should be maintained from start to finish.
- Squeeze hard at the top and control the descent for at least 2 seconds.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the dumbbells swing outward at the bottom rather than keeping them close to your sides.
- Leaning back to help curl the weight, especially as the set becomes difficult.
- Curling too fast and relying on momentum rather than controlled muscular contraction.
