## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly turned out.
2. Hold the barbell across your upper back, resting it on your traps or rear delts.
3. Engage your core and keep your chest up as you begin to lower your body down.
4. Bend at the knees and hips, pushing your hips back and down as if sitting into a chair.
5. Lower yourself until your thighs are parallel to the ground or slightly below.
6. Keep your knees in line with your toes and your weight in your heels.
7. Drive through your heels to stand back up, extending your hips and knees.
8. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Break at the hips and knees simultaneously, sitting between your hips as you descend rather than pushing your butt straight back.
- Go as deep as you can while maintaining a neutral spine; 'full squat' means getting below parallel if your mobility allows.
- Drive your knees out over your toes throughout the entire rep to keep the glutes active and prevent knee caving.

## Common mistakes

- Butt wink (posterior Pelvic Tilt) at the bottom of the squat, which rounds the lower back under load.
- Shifting onto the toes during the descent, which overloads the knees and weakens the drive out of the hole.
- Not bracing properly before each rep, leading to spinal flexion and reduced force production.

## FAQ

### How deep should a full squat go?

Ideally, your hip crease drops below the top of your knee. This maximizes glute and hamstring recruitment. Only go as deep as you can while maintaining a neutral spine.

### Is squatting below parallel bad for the knees?

No. Research consistently shows that deep squats are not inherently harmful to healthy knees. In fact, deep squats develop stronger connective tissue and more balanced leg development than partial squats.

### What's the difference between a full squat and a parallel squat?

A full squat descends until your hip crease is below your knee (below parallel). A parallel squat stops when the thighs are level with the ground. Full squats recruit more glute and hamstring.

### What muscles does the Barbell Full Squat work?

The Barbell Full Squat primarily targets the glutes, with secondary activation in the quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, core. It's classified as a strength exercise for the legs.

### Is the Barbell Full Squat good for beginners?

The Barbell Full Squat is rated as intermediate. Beginners should build a base of glutes strength with easier variations first.
