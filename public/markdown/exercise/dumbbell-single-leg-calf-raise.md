## How to perform

1. Stand on the edge of a step or platform with your heels hanging off and your toes on the step.
2. Hold a dumbbell in one hand and place your other hand on a wall or railing for support.
3. Raise your heel as high as possible, lifting your body up onto your toes.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your heel back down below the step.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch to the other leg.

## Pro tips

- Stand on the edge of a step with just the ball of your foot and let your heel drop below the step for a full calf stretch before each raise.
- Pushup as high as possible through the ball of the foot, squeezing the calf at the top for 1-2 seconds.
- Hold a dumbbell in the same hand as the working leg and use the other hand for balance on a wall or rail.

## Common mistakes

- Bouncing at the bottom instead of performing a controlled stretch and rise on each rep.
- Not dropping the heel below the step level, which cuts the range of motion and limits the stretch on the calf.
- Bending the knee during the raise, which shifts work from the gastrocnemius to the soleus.

## FAQ
