## How to perform

1. Position yourself between two parallel bars with your arms fully extended and your body suspended in the air.
2. Bend your knees and cross your ankles.
3. Lower your body by bending your elbows until your upper arms are parallel to the ground.
4. Pause for a moment, then push yourself back up to the starting position by straightening your arms.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lean your torso as far forward as possible during the descent to engage the chest and shoulders through an extreme range.
- Grip the bars tightly and keep your wrists neutral to prevent slipping during the deep bottom position.
- Build up to this movement by practicing very deep regular dips first, gradually increasing your forward lean over weeks.

## Common mistakes

- Attempting the movement without adequate shoulder flexibility, which can lead to a shoulder dislocation or strain.
- Losing tension at the bottom of the dip and collapsing into the stretch rather than controlling the descent.
- Rushing through reps instead of performing slow, controlled repetitions that build connective tissue strength.
