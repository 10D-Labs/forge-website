## How to perform

1. Sit on an incline bench with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing your torso and arms fully extended.
2. Keep your back against the bench and your feet flat on the floor.
3. While keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps.
4. Continue to raise the weights until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level.
5. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
6. Inhale and slowly begin to lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Sit on a 45-60 degree incline bench with dumbbells hanging at arm's length, palms facing each other (neutral grip). The incline stretches the brachialis from the start.
- Curl without rotating your wrists. Maintain the neutral grip throughout to target the brachialis and brachioradialis.
- Keep your elbows pointing straight at the floor and your upper arms motionless. The incline position makes cheating obvious, so use it as a form check.

## Common mistakes

- Swinging the elbows forward to make the curl easier, which eliminates the advantage of the incline position.
- Rotating the wrists to a supinated position, which turns this into an incline Bicep Curl instead of a hammer curl.
- Using too much weight. The combined stretch from the incline and the neutral grip makes this harder than standing hammer curls.

## FAQ

### What does the incline add to hammer curls?

The incline places the brachialis and long head of the bicep in a stretched position at the bottom of each rep. This increases muscle fiber recruitment and provides a stronger growth stimulus compared to standing hammer curls.

### Incline hammer curl vs incline Bicep Curl: what is the difference?

Incline hammer curls use a neutral grip (palms facing each other) to target the brachialis and brachioradialis. Incline Bicep Curls use a supinated grip (palms up) to target the bicep heads. Both benefit from the incline stretch.
