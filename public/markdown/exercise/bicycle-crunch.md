## How to perform

1. Lie flat on your back with your hands placed behind your head.
2. Lift your legs off the ground and bend your knees at a 90 degree angle.
3. Bring your right elbow towards your left knee while simultaneously straightening your right leg.
4. Return to the starting position and repeat the movement on the opposite side, bringing your left elbow towards your right knee while straightening your left leg.
5. Continue alternating sides in a pedaling motion for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Rotate your entire torso so your shoulder blade lifts off the ground, not just your elbow; the elbow should follow the rotation, not lead it.
- Extend the straight leg fully and keep it hovering 6-12 inches off the ground to maintain tension on your lower abs.
- Slow down the pedaling motion to a 2-second rotation per side instead of speed-cycling through reps.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling the head forward with the hands instead of rotating the thoracic spine, which strains the neck and reduces oblique activation.
- Moving the elbows toward the knees without actually rotating the torso, turning it into a neck exercise.
- Pedaling too fast and using momentum, which eliminates the time under tension that makes this exercise effective.

## FAQ

### Are Bicycle Crunches better than regular crunches?

Bicycle Crunches activate the rectus abdominis and obliques more than standard crunches according to ACE research. They're a more complete ab exercise because they combine rotation with flexion.

### How many Bicycle Crunches should I do per set?

Aim for 12-20 reps per side (24-40 total touches). If you can easily do more than 20 per side with good form, slow down the tempo rather than adding more reps.

### Why does my neck hurt during Bicycle Crunches?

You're likely pulling your head forward with your hands. Lightly touch your fingertips behind your ears instead of clasping your hands, and focus on lifting your shoulder blade off the ground through torso rotation.
