## How to perform

1. Sit on a flat bench with your legs extended straight out in front of you.
2. Place your hands on the bench beside your hips for support.
3. Engage your abs and lift your legs off the ground, bringing your knees towards your chest.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lean back slightly and grip the bench edges for stability. Your upper body stays relatively stationary while your legs do the work.
- Pull your knees toward your chest by curling your pelvis up, not just bending at the hips, to engage the lower abs.
- Extend your legs fully on each rep without letting your feet touch the floor to maintain tension.

## Common mistakes

- Only bending the knees without tilting the pelvis, which works the hip flexors more than the abs.
- Letting the feet rest on the ground between reps, which releases tension on the abdominals.
- Swinging the legs with momentum instead of using controlled abdominal contractions.
