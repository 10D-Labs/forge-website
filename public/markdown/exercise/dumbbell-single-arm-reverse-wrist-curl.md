## Pro tips

- Rest your forearm flat on your thigh with only the wrist hanging off the edge for a stable base.
- Curl your wrist upward slowly, focusing on the contraction along the top of your forearm (wrist extensors).
- Use a very light dumbbell (3-10 lbs) since the wrist extensors are small muscles that fatigue quickly.

## Common mistakes

- Using too heavy a weight, which forces you to jerk the wrist rather than performing a controlled curl.
- Lifting the forearm off the thigh during the curl, which adds arm movement and reduces forearm isolation.
- Performing the movement too quickly, which relies on momentum and reduces muscle activation in the forearm extensors.
