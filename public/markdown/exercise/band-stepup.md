## How to perform

1. Place a band around your thighs, just above your knees.
2. Stand facing a step or platform with your feet hip-width apart.
3. Step up onto the platform with your right foot, pushing through your heel.
4. Extend your left leg behind you, keeping it straight.
5. Lower your left foot back down to the ground.
6. Repeat with your left foot stepping up onto the platform.
7. Continue alternating legs for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Drive through the heel of the stepping foot and avoid pushing off with the back foot to isolate the working leg.
- Keep the band above your knees and push your knees outward as you step to activate the glute medius.
- Use a step height where your thigh reaches parallel or slightly above when your foot is on the platform.

## Common mistakes

- Pushing off with the trailing foot, which assists the working leg and reduces the training effect.
- Leaning the torso too far forward over the step instead of staying upright.
- Using a step that is too high for your current strength level, causing form breakdown.
