## How to perform

1. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and the barbell resting on your upper back.
2. Keeping your back straight and your core engaged, hinge forward at the hips, pushing your buttocks back as if you were trying to touch the wall behind you with your glutes.
3. Lower your torso until it is parallel to the ground, feeling a stretch in your hamstrings.
4. Pause for a moment, then return to the starting position by squeezing your glutes and pushing your hips forward.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Start with very light weight (just the bar) until you've perfected the hip hinge pattern; this exercise has a high injury risk with poor form.
- Push your hips back as far as possible while maintaining a flat back, feeling a deep stretch in the hamstrings.
- Keep a slight bend in the knees and your core braced tight throughout the entire movement.

## Common mistakes

- Rounding the back, especially the lower back, which is extremely dangerous with the barbell on your shoulders.
- Going too heavy before mastering the hip hinge, increasing the risk of back injury significantly.
- Bending the knees too much, which turns it into a squat pattern rather than a hip hinge.
