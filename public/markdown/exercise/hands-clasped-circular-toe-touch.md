## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your hands clasped together in front of your chest.
2. Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight.
3. Lower your hands towards your toes in a circular motion, reaching as far as you can without straining.
4. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then slowly return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Clasp your hands in front of your chest and use the circular reaching motion to progressively increase the stretch at each angle.
- Hinge at the hips with a flat back rather than rounding your spine to reach lower.
- Move through the circular path slowly, spending 2-3 seconds at each position in the arc.

## Common mistakes

- Rounding the spine to touch the toes instead of hinging from the hips, which strains the lower back.
- Keeping the legs completely locked straight, which limits the range of motion for people with tight hamstrings.
- Performing the circular motion too quickly, bypassing the stretch benefit at each position.
