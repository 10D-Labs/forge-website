## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a kettlebell in one hand between your legs.
2. Bend your knees slightly and hinge at the hips, lowering the kettlebell towards the ground.
3. Explosively extend your hips and knees, using the momentum to swing the kettlebell up towards your shoulder.
4. As the kettlebell reaches shoulder height, rotate your hand and punch it straight up overhead, fully extending your arm.
5. Lower the kettlebell back down between your legs and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Drive from the hips first. The arm stays loose like a rope until the kettlebell reaches chest height, then punch through overhead.
- Insert your hand around the kettlebell at the top rather than letting it flip over and bang your wrist.
- On the downswing, guide the bell back between your legs by hinging at the hips. Don't let it pull you forward.

## Common mistakes

- Using the arm to muscle the bell overhead instead of projecting it with hip drive, which leads to early fatigue and shoulder strain.
- Letting the bell swing out in a wide arc at the top instead of keeping it close and punching straight up.
- Not taming the bell on the descent, letting it pull the body forward and rounding the back.
