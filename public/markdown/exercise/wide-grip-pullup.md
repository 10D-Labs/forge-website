## How to perform

1. Hang from a pullup bar with your palms facing away from you and your hands wider than shoulder-width apart.
2. Engage your core and squeeze your shoulder blades together.
3. Pull your body up towards the bar until your chin is above the bar.
4. Lower your body back down to the starting position with control.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Grip the bar with hands roughly 1.5 times shoulder width, thumbs over the bar (false grip) or wrapped around depending on comfort.
- Drive your elbows down and toward your hips to engage the lats rather than pulling with the biceps.
- Clear the bar with your chin at the top and lower until your arms are fully extended at the bottom for complete reps.

## Common mistakes

- Going so wide that range of motion is severely limited and the shoulders take over from the lats.
- Using a kipping or swinging motion to get the chin over the bar instead of pulling with strict form.
- Performing half reps by not fully extending the arms at the bottom, which limits lat stretch and growth.
