## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and hold the cable attachment with an overhand grip.
2. Keep your back straight and your core engaged throughout the exercise.
3. Pull the cable attachment straight up towards your chin, leading with your elbows.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, squeezing your shoulder blades together.
5. Slowly lower the cable attachment back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Pull the cable straight up along your body, leading with your elbows, until the attachment reaches chin height. Your elbows should always be higher than your hands.
- Use a grip slightly wider than shoulder width to reduce impingement risk. A very narrow grip pinches the shoulder joint.
- Keep the cable close to your body throughout the pull. If it drifts forward, you lose mechanical advantage.

## Common mistakes

- Using too narrow a grip, which increases the risk of shoulder impingement by forcing the shoulder into excessive internal rotation.
- Pulling the cable too high above chin level, which puts the shoulder in a vulnerable position.
- Shrugging at the top instead of leading with the elbows, which turns this into a shrug rather than a delt and trap exercise.
