2. Sit on the bench with your back against the pad and your feet flat on the ground.

4. Extend your arms fully, lifting the bar off the rack and holding it directly above your chest.
5. Lower the bar slowly towards your forehead, keeping your elbows close to your head.
6. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push the bar back up to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Set the incline bench inside the Smith machine and position the bar so it's directly above your forehead at full extension.
- Lower the bar by bending at the elbows only, keeping your upper arms stationary and perpendicular to the floor.
- The Smith machine's fixed path ensures consistent form; focus on slow, controlled reps.

- Flaring the elbows wide during the extension, reducing tricep isolation.
- Using too much weight and letting the bar drop quickly, relying on the Smith machine's safety to catch it.
