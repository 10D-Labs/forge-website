## How to perform

1. Sit on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand, resting on your thighs.
2. Using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width.
3. Once at shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. This will be your starting position.
4. As you breathe in, slowly lower the dumbbells to your side until they are about level with your chest.
5. As you exhale, use your triceps to lift the dumbbells back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hold the dumbbells with a neutral grip (palms facing each other) and keep them touching or very close together throughout the press. This narrow position shifts the load to the triceps.
- Lower the dumbbells to the center of your chest with your elbows tight to your sides, then press straight up.
- Squeeze the dumbbells together at the top of each rep to maximize the tricep and inner chest contraction.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the dumbbells drift apart during the press, which turns this into a standard bench press and reduces tricep emphasis.
- Flaring the elbows outward, which shifts the load to the chest and shoulders and away from the triceps.
- Using too much weight and compensating by arching the back excessively.
