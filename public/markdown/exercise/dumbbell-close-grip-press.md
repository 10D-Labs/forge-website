## How to Perform Dumbbell Close Grip Press

1. Sit on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand, resting on your thighs.
2. Using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width.
3. Once at shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. This will be your starting position.
4. As you breathe in, slowly lower the dumbbells to your side until they are about level with your chest.
5. As you exhale, use your triceps to lift the dumbbells back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
