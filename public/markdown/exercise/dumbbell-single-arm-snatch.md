## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in one hand with an overhand grip.
2. Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight and chest up.
3. Lower the dumbbell towards the ground, keeping it close to your body.
4. Explosively extend your hips, knees, and ankles, driving the dumbbell upwards in a straight line.
5. As the dumbbell reaches shoulder height, quickly rotate your hand and punch it overhead, fully extending your arm.
6. Catch the dumbbell overhead with a slight bend in your knees and hips.
7. Lower the dumbbell back down to the starting position in a controlled manner.
8. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch to the other arm.

## Pro tips

- Generate power from your hips by snapping them forward, not by pulling with your arm.
- Keep the dumbbell close to your body on the way up, like zipping a jacket from hip to overhead.
- Catch the dumbbell overhead with a slight bend in the knees to absorb the force.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling the weight with the arm from the start instead of using the hip hinge to generate power.
- Letting the dumbbell swing away from the body, which creates a longer lever arm and strains the shoulder.
- Not fully locking out the arm overhead, which means you're not completing the movement safely.
