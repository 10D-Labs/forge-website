4. Raise your heels as high as possible, using your calves to lift your body.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your heels back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Stand with just the balls of your feet on the barbell and Pushup as high as you can on your toes for a full contraction.
- Hold onto a rack or wall for balance since the round barbell surface makes this an unstable exercise.
- Pause at the top for a 2-second squeeze to maximize calf activation.

## Common mistakes

- Placing too much of the foot on the barbell, which reduces the range of motion for the calf raise.
- Rushing through reps without pausing at the top, missing out on peak contraction.
- Not securing the barbell against a wall or rack, allowing it to roll away during the set.
