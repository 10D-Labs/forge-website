## How to perform

1. Attach a weight belt with the desired weight or wear a weighted vest.
2. Hang from gymnast rings with arms fully extended and a false grip (wrists over the rings).
3. Engage your core and pull yourself up explosively, bringing your chest toward the rings.
4. As you reach the top of the pull, lean forward and transition your hands from below to above the rings.
5. Press yourself up by straightening your arms until you're in the support position above the rings.
6. Lower yourself back down with control, reversing the movement.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Master at least 5 strict Ring Muscle Ups with bodyweight before adding any external load.
- Use a false grip that wraps your wrists over the top of the rings to maintain control during the transition phase.
- Start with very light weight (2-5 lbs) and focus on an aggressive kip-to-pull transition to compensate for the added load.

## Common mistakes

- Adding too much weight too soon, which breaks down the transition and puts excessive strain on the shoulders.
- Losing the false grip during the pull phase, causing a failed transition or wrist injury.
- Neglecting the controlled descent, which wastes the eccentric strengthening benefit of the movement.
