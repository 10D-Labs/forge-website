# Weighted Ring Muscle Up - Forge Exercise Library

## Quick Answer

The weighted ring muscle up is an advanced gymnastic exercise performed on rings with added weight via a belt or vest. It combines a pull-up and dip in one fluid motion, requiring exceptional upper body strength, coordination, and ring stability. The instability of the rings makes this significantly harder than a bar muscle up.

## How to Perform Weighted Ring Muscle Up

1. Attach a weight belt with the desired weight or wear a weighted vest.
2. Hang from gymnast rings with arms fully extended and a false grip (wrists over the rings).
3. Engage your core and pull yourself up explosively, bringing your chest toward the rings.
4. As you reach the top of the pull, lean forward and transition your hands from below to above the rings.
5. Press yourself up by straightening your arms until you're in the support position above the rings.
6. Lower yourself back down with control, reversing the movement.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
