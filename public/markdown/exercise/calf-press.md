## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat of the machine so that your shoulders are aligned with The pad.
2. Place your toes on The pad, with your heels hanging off the edge.
3. Grasp the handles or side supports for stability.
4. Push The pad down by extending your ankles, contracting your calf muscles.
5. Pause for a moment at the bottom of the movement.
6. Slowly return to the starting position by allowing your heels to rise back up.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Push through the balls of your feet and focus on getting a full contraction at the bottom of each press.
- Hold the fully pointed position for 1-2 seconds to maximize the peak contraction on the calves.
- Lower your heels slowly for a full 2-3 second eccentric to get a deep stretch at the top.

## Common mistakes

- Using a bouncing motion at the bottom of each rep instead of controlled pressing, which reduces muscle activation and risks Achilles strain.
- Not going through the full range of motion, especially skipping the stretch at the top of the movement.
- Placing the feet too far forward on the platform, which shifts the load to the quads and reduces calf involvement.
