## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand with an overhand grip.
2. Keeping your back straight and your core engaged, hinge at the hips and lower the dumbbells towards the ground, allowing your torso to lean forward.
3. Continue lowering the dumbbells until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings, keeping your knees slightly bent.
4. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then engage your glutes and hamstrings to lift your torso back up to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep a soft bend in your knees throughout the movement to protect your lower back and maintain tension on the hamstrings.
- Think about pushing your hips straight back like you're closing a car door with your butt rather than bending your torso forward.
- Let the dumbbells travel close to your legs as if you're shaving them, which keeps the load centered over your base of support.

## Common mistakes

- Rounding the lower back at the bottom of the movement instead of maintaining a flat or slightly arched spine.
- Locking the knees completely, which shifts stress off the hamstrings and onto the lower back.
- Letting the dumbbells drift away from the body, creating excessive torque on the lumbar spine.

## FAQ

### What's the difference between a straight leg Deadlift and a Romanian Deadlift?

You should feel your lower back working to stabilize, but the primary stretch and burn should be in your hamstrings and glutes. If your lower back is the limiting factor, you may be rounding your spine.
