## How to perform

1. Attach a straight bar to a high pulley cable machine.
2. Stand facing away from the machine with your feet shoulder-width apart.
3. Grasp the bar with an overhand grip, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
4. Lean forward slightly and keep your back straight.
5. Pull the bar down towards your thighs by extending your elbows.
6. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then slowly return the bar to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your arms straight throughout the movement. This is a lat isolation exercise, not a tricep pushdown. Think about driving the bar toward your hips in an arc.
- Lean forward about 20-30 degrees from vertical to align the cable path with your lat fibers for maximum stretch and contraction.
- Squeeze your lats hard at the bottom position where the bar reaches your thighs, holding for a one-second count.

## Common mistakes

- Bending the elbows excessively, which turns this into a tricep pushdown instead of a lat-focused movement.
- Standing too close to the cable machine, which shortens the range of motion and reduces the lat stretch at the top.
- Using too much weight and compensating with body momentum rather than isolating the lats.
