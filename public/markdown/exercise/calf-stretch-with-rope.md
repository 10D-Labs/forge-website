## How to perform

1. Stand facing a wall or sturdy object with your feet hip-width apart.
2. Hold the ends of the rope in each hand and place the middle of the rope around the ball of your right foot.
3. Step back with your left foot, keeping your heel on the ground and your leg straight.
4. Lean forward, keeping your back straight, and gently pull on the rope to stretch your calf.
5. Hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds, then release.
6. Repeat on the other leg.

## Pro tips

- Sit with your leg extended straight and loop the rope or band around the ball of your foot, not the toes.
- Pull gently and steadily toward you until you feel a strong but comfortable stretch in the calf.
- Keep your knee straight to target the gastrocnemius, or bend slightly to shift the stretch to the soleus.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling too aggressively and overstretching, which can irritate the Achilles tendon.
- Placing the rope too far forward on the toes, which stretches the foot arch rather than the calf.
- Rounding the back and hunching forward to reach the rope instead of sitting tall.
