3. Move your right hand and left foot forward simultaneously, followed by your left hand and right foot.
4. Continue crawling forward, alternating your hand and foot movements.
5. Maintain a steady pace and keep your core tight throughout the exercise.
6. Continue for your target duration.

## Pro tips

- Keep your knees hovering just 1-2 inches off the ground to maximize core engagement.
- Move contralateral limbs together (right hand with left foot) to maintain balance and natural crawling rhythm.
- Look slightly ahead of your hands, not straight down, to maintain a neutral neck position.

## Common mistakes

- Raising the hips too high into a pike position, which takes tension off the core and shifts it to the shoulders.
- Moving the same-side arm and leg simultaneously instead of opposite limbs, which creates an awkward lurch.
- Taking steps that are too large, which destabilizes your position and reduces the core training effect.
