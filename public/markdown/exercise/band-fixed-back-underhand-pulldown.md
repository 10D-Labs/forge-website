## How to perform

1. Attach the band to a sturdy anchor point above your head.
2. Stand facing the anchor point with your feet shoulder-width apart.
3. Grasp the band with an underhand grip, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
4. Step back to create tension in the band, keeping your arms fully extended.
5. Engage your core and squeeze your shoulder blades together.
6. Pull the band down towards your chest, leading with your elbows.
7. Pause for a moment at the bottom of the movement, feeling the contraction in your lats.
8. Slowly release the tension in the band and return to the starting position.
9. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use an underhand grip to increase bicep involvement and target the lower lats more effectively.
- Pull the band all the way to your upper chest and squeeze your shoulder blades together at the bottom.
- Step far enough back from the anchor to maintain tension throughout the entire range of motion.

## Common mistakes

- Standing too close to the anchor point, which provides no tension at the top of the movement and reduces the effective range.
- Pulling with the arms only instead of initiating the movement from the shoulder blades and lats.
- Using a band with too much resistance, which forces you to lean back excessively and use momentum.
