## How to perform

1. Lie flat on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground.
2. Place your hands behind your head with your elbows pointing outwards.
3. Engage your abs and lift your shoulders off the ground, curling forward towards your knees.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your shoulders back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Press your lower back into the floor and keep it there throughout the crunch. Only your shoulder blades should lift off the ground.
- Place your hands behind your head for support, not to pull. Your fingertips should barely touch your head.
- Exhale forcefully as you crunch up and hold the top position for one second to maximize the contraction in the upper abs.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling the head forward with the hands, which strains the neck and reduces ab engagement.
- Sitting up too high (turning it into a sit-up), which shifts the work from the abs to the hip flexors.
- Using a fast, bouncing motion without controlling the eccentric, which reduces time under tension.
