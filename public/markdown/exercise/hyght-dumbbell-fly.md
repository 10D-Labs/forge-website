## How to perform

1. Lie flat on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing each other.
2. Extend your arms straight up over your chest, with a slight bend in your elbows.
3. Keeping a slight bend in your elbows, lower the dumbbells out to the sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch in your chest.
4. Pause for a moment, then reverse the movement and bring the dumbbells back to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep a slight bend in your elbows throughout the entire arc and do not change the elbow angle as you lower.
- Lower the dumbbells in a wide arc until you feel a stretch across your chest, then reverse by squeezing the pecs.
- Think about hugging a large barrel as you bring the dumbbells back together at the top.

## Common mistakes

- Straightening the arms at the bottom of the fly, which puts excessive stress on the elbow and shoulder joints.
- Turning the fly into a press by bending the elbows too much, which recruits the triceps and reduces chest isolation.
- Using too heavy a weight, which forces a shorter range of motion and reduces the chest stretch at the bottom.
