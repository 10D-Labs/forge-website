## How to perform

2. Engage your back muscles and pull your body up towards the bar, keeping your elbows close to your body.
3. Continue pulling until your chin is above the bar.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your body back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use a narrow parallel grip (palms facing each other) and pull until your chin clears the bar, focusing on driving your elbows down toward your hips.
- The neutral grip reduces shoulder strain compared to a standard Chinup while emphasizing the brachialis and lower lats.
- Squeeze at the top for a one-second hold, then lower yourself for a full 2-3 seconds to maximize the eccentric contraction.

## Common mistakes

- Using a grip that is too wide for the neutral handles, which changes the angle and reduces the brachialis emphasis.
- Kipping or swinging the legs to generate momentum, which reduces back and bicep engagement.
- Not going to full arm extension at the bottom, which shortens the range of motion and limits lat stretch.
