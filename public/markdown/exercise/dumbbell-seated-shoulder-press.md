## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand, resting on your thighs.
2. Raise the dumbbells to shoulder height, palms facing forward.
3. Press the dumbbells upward until your arms are fully extended overhead.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbells back to shoulder height.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Start with the dumbbells at shoulder height with palms forward, press to full lockout, and lower back to ear level on each rep.
- Keep your back pressed against the bench and core braced to prevent excessive arching during the press.
- Drive the dumbbells slightly inward at the top so they nearly touch, which maximizes the delt contraction at lockout.

## Common mistakes

- Arching the lower back off the bench to help press heavier weight, which stresses the spine.
- Not pressing through the full range of motion, stopping before full lockout or not lowering to shoulder level.
- Flaring the elbows too far back, which puts the shoulder in a vulnerable position.
