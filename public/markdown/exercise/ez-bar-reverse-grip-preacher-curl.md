## How to perform

1. Sit on a preacher bench with your chest against the pad and your feet flat on the floor.
2. Grasp the ez barbell with an underhand grip, hands shoulder-width apart.
3. Rest your upper arms on the pad, allowing your forearms to hang down.
4. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the barbell up towards your shoulders.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then inhale and slowly lower the barbell back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Press the backs of your upper arms firmly into the preacher pad throughout the movement to eliminate momentum.
- Use a slow, controlled eccentric of 3 seconds to maximize brachioradialis and forearm engagement.
- Don't fully lock out at the bottom to keep constant tension on the forearms and avoid hyperextending the elbows.

## Common mistakes

- Lifting the elbows off the pad at the top of the curl, which allows the shoulders to assist and reduces isolation.
- Letting the weight drop quickly at the bottom, which stresses the elbow joint and wastes the eccentric portion.
- Gripping the bar too wide or too narrow for the reverse grip, which shifts stress to the wrists.
