- Pull with your elbows driving straight back, not out to the sides, and finish with the bar touching your lower chest.
- Squeeze your shoulder blades together for a full second at the top of each rep.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the hips sag or pike, breaking the straight-line body position that makes this exercise effective.
- Using a partial range of motion by not pulling the chest all the way to the bar.
- Looking up at the bar during the pull, which hyperextends the neck instead of keeping it neutral.
