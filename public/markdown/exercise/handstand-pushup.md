## How to perform

1. Find a wall and face away from it, standing a few feet away.
2. Place your hands on the ground shoulder-width apart and kick your feet up against the wall, coming into a handstand position.
3. Bend your elbows and lower your head towards the ground, keeping your body in a straight line.
4. Push through your hands and extend your arms to return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Place your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width and spread your fingers for a stable base against the wall.
- Look at the ground between your hands (not at the wall) to keep your neck in a neutral position throughout the press.
- Lower yourself until the top of your head just touches the ground, then press back up forcefully through your palms.

## Common mistakes

- Flaring elbows out at 90 degrees like a bench press, which strains the shoulders. Keep elbows at about 45 degrees.
- Losing core tension and letting the lower back arch excessively, which destabilizes the Handstand position.
- Kicking up too aggressively into the wall, risking wrist injury or falling over.
