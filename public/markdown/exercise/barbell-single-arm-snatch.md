## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointing slightly outwards.
2. Hold the barbell with an overhand grip, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3. Bend your knees and lower your hips into a squat position, keeping your back straight and chest up.
4. Explosively extend your hips, knees, and ankles, driving the barbell upwards.
5. As the barbell reaches chest level, pull it upwards with your arm, keeping it close to your body.
6. Rotate your elbow under the barbell and extend your arm fully overhead, locking out your elbow.
7. Lower the barbell back down to the starting position in a controlled manner.
8. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch arms.

## Pro tips

- Start with the bar in one hand at mid-thigh and use an explosive hip extension to drive it overhead in one fluid motion.
- Keep the bar close to your body throughout the pull and punch your hand toward the ceiling as you receive the bar overhead.
- Lock the bar out overhead with your bicep next to your ear and hold for a full second before lowering.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling with the arm instead of using the hips to generate the initial power, leading to a slow, muscled-up lift.
- Letting the bar swing out in front, which puts the shoulder in a dangerous position and makes the catch unstable.
- Not fully extending the hips before pulling under the bar, which limits the height the bar can reach.
