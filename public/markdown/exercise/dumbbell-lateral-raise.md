## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing your body.
2. Keep your back straight and engage your core.
3. Raise your arms out to the sides until they are parallel to the floor, keeping a slight bend in your elbows.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your arms back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lead with your elbows, not your hands. Imagine pouring water out of a pitcher at the top to engage the lateral delt.
- Stop at or just below shoulder height to keep constant tension on the side delts and avoid upper trap takeover.
- Use a controlled 1-second lift and 2-second lower tempo to maximize muscle activation with lighter weights.

## Common mistakes

- Swinging the body or using hip thrust to cheat the dumbbells up, which removes the stimulus from the lateral delts.
- Raising the arms too high above shoulder level, which shifts the work to the upper traps and can impinge the shoulder.
- Keeping the arms perfectly straight, which puts unnecessary stress on the elbow joint. A slight 10-15 degree bend is safer.

Lateral delts respond well to volume. 3-5 sets of 12-20 reps is a common and effective range for building wider shoulders.
