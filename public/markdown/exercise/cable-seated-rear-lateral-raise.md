## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench facing the cable machine with your feet flat on the ground.
2. Grasp the cable handles with an overhand grip and extend your arms straight in front of you.
3. Keeping your arms straight, slowly raise them out to the sides until they are parallel to the floor.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your arms back to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Sit facing the cable machine and lean forward slightly from the hips to align the movement with the rear deltoid muscle fibers.
- Keep your arms nearly straight with just a slight elbow bend, and raise them out to the sides in a wide arc, not backward.
- Use lighter weight than standing raises since the seated position eliminates momentum, making each rep stricter.

## Common mistakes

- Sitting too upright, which turns this into a Lateral Raise for the middle delts rather than a rear delt exercise.
- Bending the elbows too much during the raise, which shortens the lever arm and recruits the biceps.
- Shrugging the shoulders during the raise, which shifts tension to the upper traps.
