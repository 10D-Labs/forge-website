## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Step forward with your right foot and shift your weight onto your right leg.
3. Keeping your back straight, slowly bend forward at the hips, reaching towards your right foot with both hands.
4. Hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds, then return to the starting position.
5. Repeat on the other side.

## Pro tips

- Keep your front leg straight and hinge forward from the hips, not the lower back, to target the hamstrings directly.
- Flex your front foot (toes pointing up) to increase the stretch intensity on the calf and hamstring.
- Hold the stretch at the point of mild discomfort, not pain, and breathe into the position for 20-30 seconds.

## Common mistakes

- Rounding the back to reach further toward the foot, which stretches the spine instead of the hamstrings.
- Bending the front knee, which shortens the hamstring and eliminates the stretch.
- Bouncing in and out of the stretch, which triggers the stretch reflex and can cause muscle strain.
