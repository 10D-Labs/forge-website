## How to perform

1. Grab the pullup bar with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
2. Hang from the bar with your arm fully extended and your body straight.
3. Engage your core and pull your body up towards the bar by bending your elbow and squeezing your back muscles.
4. Continue pulling until your chin is above the bar.
5. Lower your body back down to the starting position with control.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Train unweighted one-arm Pullups for at least 3 solid reps before adding any external load.
- Grip the bar with your thumb wrapped around it and squeeze as hard as possible to recruit more lat fibers.
- Initiate the pull by depressing your shoulder blade first, then drive your elbow down toward your hip.

## Common mistakes

- Using excessive body rotation or kipping to compensate for the added weight, which reduces the training effect.
- Gripping the bar with only the fingers instead of a full grip, which limits force production and risks a fall.
- Neglecting grip and forearm training, which becomes the limiting factor long before lat strength does.
