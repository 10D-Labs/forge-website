2. Grab a dumbbell in each hand and sit on the bench with your chest against the incline.
3. Extend your arms fully, allowing the dumbbells to hang straight down from your shoulders.
4. Pull the dumbbells up towards your chest, squeezing your shoulder blades together.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Let the dumbbells hang straight down at the bottom with your arms fully extended to get a full stretch on the lats before each pull.
- Drive your elbows back past your torso and squeeze your shoulder blades together hard at the top for peak upper back contraction.
- Keep your chest glued to the bench throughout to prevent your body from lifting and using momentum.

## Common mistakes

- Shrugging the shoulders up toward the ears during the row, which shifts the load from the upper back to the traps.
- Using too heavy a weight and only pulling halfway up, losing the most effective part of the range of motion.
- Lifting the chest off the bench at the top of the row, which introduces momentum and reduces back isolation.
