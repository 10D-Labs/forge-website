## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Take a step forward with your right foot, keeping your back straight.
3. Lower your body by bending your knees until your right thigh is parallel to the ground.
4. Push through your right heel to return to the starting position.
5. Repeat with your left leg.
6. Continue alternating legs for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Take a longer-than-normal step to increase the hip flexor and quad stretch on the back leg.
- Keep your torso upright and your chest tall to deepen the stretch through the front of the trailing hip.
- Hold the bottom position for 2-3 seconds to get the stretch benefit before pushing back to start.

## Common mistakes

- Taking too short a step, which eliminates the stretch component and makes it a regular weighted lunge.
- Rounding the upper back forward under the load instead of maintaining an upright torso.
- Bouncing out of the bottom position instead of pausing to actually achieve the stretch.
