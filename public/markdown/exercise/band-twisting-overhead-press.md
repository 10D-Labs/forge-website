2. Hold the band handles at shoulder height with your palms facing forward.
3. Engage your core and press the band overhead, fully extending your arms.
4. As you press, twist your torso to one side, keeping your hips stable.

6. Repeat the press and twist on the opposite side.
7. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

- Not pressing to full lockout overhead, which reduces shoulder engagement.
- Using too thick a band, which causes form breakdown on the pressing and twisting components.
