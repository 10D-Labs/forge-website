## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing your body.
2. Keep your arms straight and let the dumbbells hang by your sides.
3. Raise your shoulders as high as possible, as if you are trying to touch your ears with your shoulders.
4. Hold the contraction for a second, then slowly lower your shoulders back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Shrug straight up toward your ears as if trying to touch your shoulders to your earlobes, and hold the top for 1-2 seconds.
- Keep your arms completely straight throughout; do not bend the elbows or row the weight.
- Use straps if your grip gives out before your traps, since traps can handle far more weight than your grip strength.

## Common mistakes

- Rolling the shoulders in circles, which adds no benefit and can stress the shoulder joint.
- Bending the elbows and turning the shrug into a partial upright row.
- Using too much weight and only achieving a tiny range of motion, which barely activates the upper traps.
