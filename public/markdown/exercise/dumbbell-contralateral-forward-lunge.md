## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand.
2. Take a step forward with your right foot, keeping your back straight and core engaged.
3. Lower your body by bending both knees until your right thigh is parallel to the ground.
4. Push through your right heel to return to the starting position.
5. Repeat with your left leg.
6. Alternate legs for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hold the dumbbell on the opposite side from the lunging leg to challenge your core's anti-rotation stability.
- Keep the dumbbell at your side with a neutral grip and resist any torso lean toward the loaded side.
- Step far enough forward that your front shin stays vertical at the bottom of the lunge.

## Common mistakes

- Holding the weight on the same side as the stepping leg, which changes the exercise to an ipsilateral lunge.
- Leaning the torso toward the dumbbell side instead of staying perfectly upright.
- Rushing through reps and not pausing at the bottom to establish balance and control.

## FAQ

### What does contralateral mean in this exercise?

Contralateral means opposite side. You hold the dumbbell in the hand opposite to the lunging leg, which creates a cross-body stability demand that engages the obliques and deep core muscles.

### How heavy should the dumbbell be?

Start lighter than you think, around 15-25 lbs. The asymmetric loading makes balance much harder than a standard lunge, so the core is often the limiting factor, not the legs.

### What's the benefit over a regular Dumbbell Lunge?

The contralateral loading forces your core to resist rotation and lateral flexion, which builds functional stability that transfers directly to sports and daily activities.

### What muscles does the Dumbbell Contralateral Forward Lunge work?

The Dumbbell Contralateral Forward Lunge primarily targets the glutes, with secondary activation in the quadriceps, hamstrings, calves. It's classified as a strength exercise for the legs.

### Is the Dumbbell Contralateral Forward Lunge good for beginners?

The Dumbbell Contralateral Forward Lunge is rated as intermediate. Beginners should build a base of glutes strength with easier variations first.
