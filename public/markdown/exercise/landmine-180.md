## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold the barbell with both hands in front of your chest.
2. Bend your knees slightly and rotate your torso to the right, swinging the barbell down towards your right hip.
3. As you reach the bottom of the movement, quickly reverse the motion and rotate your torso to the left, swinging the barbell up and across your body towards your left shoulder.
4. Continue this twisting motion, alternating sides, for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your arms mostly straight and rotate the barbell in an arc from hip to hip using your core and hips to drive the rotation.
- Pivot on the balls of your feet as you rotate to protect your knees and allow full hip rotation.
- Control the barbell at the bottom of each side. Don't let gravity slam it down.

## Common mistakes

- Using the arms to swing the barbell rather than rotating from the core and hips.
- Keeping the feet planted and twisting only at the waist, which stresses the lumbar spine.
- Going too heavy and losing control of the barbell at the transition points.
