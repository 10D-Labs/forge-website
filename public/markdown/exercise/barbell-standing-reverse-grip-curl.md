## How to perform

1. Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a barbell with an underhand grip, palms facing up.
2. Keep your elbows close to your torso and your upper arms stationary.
3. Exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps, bringing the barbell as close to your shoulders as possible.
4. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
5. Inhale and slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hold the bar with a supinated (underhand, palms-up) grip and keep your elbows at your sides throughout.
- This is essentially the same as a standard Barbell Curl; focus on a strict controlled motion without body swing.
- Squeeze the biceps at the top and resist the weight on the way down for maximum growth stimulus.

## Common mistakes

- Using momentum by swinging the hips forward to start each rep.
- Letting the elbows drift forward during the curl, which shortens the range of motion.
- Gripping too tightly, which fatigues the forearms before the biceps are fully worked.

## FAQ

### How is a reverse grip curl different from a regular curl?

The name is slightly misleading. A 'reverse grip' here means an underhand (supinated) grip, which is actually the standard curl grip. True reverse curls use an overhand (pronated) grip. This exercise targets the biceps directly.

### What rep range works best for Bicep Curls?

8-15 reps per set produces the best hypertrophy for biceps. Going too heavy (under 6 reps) often leads to form breakdown, and the biceps respond well to moderate loads with controlled tempo.

### How many times per week should I curl?

2-3 sessions per week with 3-4 sets per session provides enough volume for bicep growth while allowing recovery. Space sessions at least 48 hours apart.

### What muscles does the Barbell Standing Reverse Grip Curl work?

The Barbell Standing Reverse Grip Curl primarily targets the biceps, with secondary activation in the forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.

### Is the Barbell Standing Reverse Grip Curl good for beginners?

Yes, the Barbell Standing Reverse Grip Curl is rated as a beginner-level exercise. It's a great starting point for building biceps strength.
