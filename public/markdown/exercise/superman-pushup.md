2. Engage your core and lower your body towards the ground, keeping your elbows close to your sides.
3. As you lower your body, simultaneously lift your right arm and left leg off the ground, extending them straight out.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then lower your arm and leg back down while pushing yourself back up to the starting position.
5. Repeat the movement, this time lifting your left arm and right leg.
6. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lower into the Pushup slowly, then explosively push off the ground to create the airtime needed to extend your arms and legs.
- Extend opposite arm and leg simultaneously (or both arms and legs for the hardest version) while airborne.
- Land with soft elbows to absorb the impact and protect your joints.

## Common mistakes

- Not generating enough explosive force to get airborne, resulting in a grounded version that isn't the intended exercise.
- Landing with stiff, locked elbows, which transmits all the impact force into the joints.
- Losing core tension during the airborne phase, causing the hips to sag on landing.
