# Decline Crunch

## Quick answer

The decline crunch is an abdominal exercise performed on a decline bench, targeting the abs and engaging the hip flexors as secondary muscles. It involves curling the torso upward while lying on a downward-sloping surface. Intermediate core exercise using body weight. Targets abs, also works hip flexors.

## How to perform

1. Lie on a decline bench with your feet secured and your knees bent at a 90 degree angle.
2. Place your hands behind your head or across your chest.
3. Engage your abs and lift your upper body towards your knees, curling your torso.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your upper body back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Secure your feet at the top of the decline bench and lie back. The decline angle increases the range of motion and gravity resistance compared to floor crunches.
- Curl your spine segment by segment. Do not sit all the way up; stop when your abs are fully contracted, which is about 30-40 degrees off the bench.
- Lower yourself slowly (3 seconds) back to the start. The decline forces a longer eccentric, which is great for ab development.

## Common mistakes

- Sitting all the way up past the contraction point, which uses the hip flexors for the top half of the movement.
- Using momentum to swing up rather than curling the spine with ab strength.
- Setting the bench angle too steep, which makes the exercise hip-flexor dominant and increases lower back stress.

## FAQ

### What angle should the decline bench be for Decline Crunches?

Start with a 30-degree decline. As you get stronger, increase to 45 degrees. Steeper angles are harder but can shift emphasis to the hip flexors if core strength is not sufficient.

### Are Decline Crunches better than flat crunches?

Decline Crunches provide greater range of motion and more resistance due to gravity, making them harder and more effective for ab development than flat crunches. They are a natural progression from floor crunches.

### What muscles does the Decline Crunch work?

The Decline Crunch primarily targets the abs, with secondary activation in the hip flexors. It's classified as a strength exercise for the core.

### Is the Decline Crunch good for beginners?

The Decline Crunch is rated as intermediate. Beginners should build a base of abs strength with easier variations first.
