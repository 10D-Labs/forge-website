## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and the barbell resting on your upper back.
2. Keeping your chest up and core engaged, slowly lower your body by bending your knees and pushing your hips back.
3. Continue lowering until your thighs are parallel to the ground or slightly below.
4. Pause for a moment, then push through your heels to return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Create a tight upper back shelf by squeezing your shoulder blades together and positioning the bar on your rear deltoids.
- Use a wider grip on the bar if you lack the shoulder mobility for a close grip, but always keep the bar secure.
- Initiate the movement by pushing your hips back first, then bending the knees, to maintain the proper low-bar torso angle.

## Common mistakes

- Not pushing the hips back enough, which causes the knees to travel too far forward and reduces posterior chain loading.
- Losing the tight upper back position during the squat, allowing the bar to shift and the chest to collapse.
- Squatting with the torso too upright, as if performing a high bar squat, which creates an inefficient bar path.

## FAQ

### Is the low bar squat better than the high bar squat?

Neither is universally better. Low bar allows more weight and emphasizes the posterior chain. High bar has greater quad emphasis and requires less shoulder mobility. Choose based on your goals.

### Why does my wrist hurt during low bar squats?

Your wrists are bearing bar weight because your upper back shelf is not tight enough. Focus on squeezing your shoulder blades together harder and use a wider grip to reduce wrist strain.

### How deep should I squat with low bar?

Squat to at least parallel (hip crease at or below the top of the knee). Going deeper is fine if your mobility allows it without lower back rounding.

### What muscles does the Barbell Low Bar Squat work?

The Barbell Low Bar Squat primarily targets the glutes, with secondary activation in the quadriceps, hamstrings, calves. It's classified as a strength exercise for the legs.

### Is the Barbell Low Bar Squat good for beginners?

The Barbell Low Bar Squat is rated as intermediate. Beginners should build a base of glutes strength with easier variations first.
