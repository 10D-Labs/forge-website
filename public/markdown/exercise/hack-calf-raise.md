## How to perform

1. Adjust the leg press machine to a comfortable weight.
2. Stand on the leg press machine with your toes on the platform and your heels hanging off.
3. Hold onto the handles for stability.
4. Raise your heels as high as possible by pushing through the balls of your feet.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your heels back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Position only the balls of your feet on the bottom edge of the platform with your heels hanging off completely.
- Use the machine shoulder pads for stability and focus entirely on the ankle extension movement.

## Common mistakes

- Standing with too much foot on the platform, which limits the range of motion at the bottom of the movement.
- Locking the knees completely, which can hyperextend them under load. Keep a very slight bend.
- Using the quads to assist by bending and extending the knees during the calf raise.
