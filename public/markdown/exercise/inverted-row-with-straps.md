## How to perform

1. Set up a suspension trainer or straps at chest height.
2. Stand facing the anchor point and grab the handles with an overhand grip.
3. Walk your feet forward, leaning back until your body is at an angle.
4. Keep your body straight and engage your core.
5. Pull your chest towards the handles, squeezing your shoulder blades together.
6. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower yourself back to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Adjust the strap length so you're at a challenging angle. The more horizontal your body, the harder the exercise.
- Pull your chest to the handles by driving your elbows back and squeezing your shoulder blades together.
- Keep your body rigid like a plank throughout the pull. Don't let your hips sag or pike.

## Common mistakes

- Bending at the hips and piking up during the pull, which makes the exercise easier but removes back engagement.
- Not pulling the handles all the way to the chest, cutting the range of motion short and limiting upper back development.
- Shrugging the shoulders up toward the ears instead of keeping them depressed and retracted.
