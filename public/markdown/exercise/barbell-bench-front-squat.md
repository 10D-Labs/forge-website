## How to perform

1. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and the barbell resting on your upper chest, just below your collarbone.
2. Hold the barbell with an overhand grip, keeping your elbows up and your upper arms parallel to the ground.
3. Lower your body down into a squat position by bending at the knees and hips, keeping your back straight and your chest up.
4. Pause for a moment at the bottom of the squat, then push through your heels to return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Position the barbell on your upper chest at your clavicle, not on your throat, and keep your elbows high to create a stable shelf.
- Sit down toward a bench behind you as a depth reference, lightly touching before driving back up.
- Keep your torso as vertical as possible; if the bar rolls forward, your elbows have dropped too low.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the elbows drop, which causes the bar to roll forward and puts stress on the wrists and lower back.
- Sitting too far back on the bench instead of just tapping it, which kills momentum and puts the spine in a compromised position.
- Not hitting adequate depth because the front-loaded position feels uncomfortable at the bottom.
