## Pro tips

- Stand with the bar at hip height and your feet about 6 inches in front of the bar path to create a natural curl arc.
- Keep your elbows pinned to your sides and curl the bar up by contracting only the biceps.
- Rotate the bar hooks to unlock, then maintain constant tension throughout each rep.

## Common mistakes

- Standing directly under the bar, which limits the range of motion and feels unnatural.
- Using the fixed bar path as an excuse to load too much weight and use body momentum.
- Not fully extending at the bottom because the fixed path makes the bottom of the curl feel awkward.
