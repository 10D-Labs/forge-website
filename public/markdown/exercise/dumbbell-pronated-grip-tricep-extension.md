## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench or chair with your back straight and feet flat on the ground.
2. Hold a dumbbell with both hands, palms facing down, and extend your arms straight up overhead.
3. Keeping your upper arms close to your head and elbows pointing forward, slowly lower the dumbbell behind your head by bending your elbows.
4. Pause for a moment, then extend your arms back up to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your palms facing down (pronated) throughout the extension to shift emphasis to the lateral and medial heads of the triceps.
- Hold the dumbbell with both hands and lower it behind your head slowly, keeping your elbows pointed forward and close together.
- Squeeze the triceps fully at the top before beginning each rep's lowering phase.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the elbows flare out to the sides, which reduces triceps isolation and can stress the shoulder joints.
- Arching the lower back as the dumbbell goes behind the head, which puts compressive force on the lumbar spine.
- Using momentum to swing the dumbbell up rather than extending strictly from the elbows.
