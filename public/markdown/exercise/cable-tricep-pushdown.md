## How to perform

1. Attach a straight bar to a high pulley cable machine.
2. Stand facing the machine with your feet shoulder-width apart and a slight bend in your knees.
3. Grasp the bar with an overhand grip, hands shoulder-width apart.
4. Keep your elbows close to your sides and your upper arms stationary.
5. Exhale and push the bar down until your elbows are fully extended.
6. Pause for a moment, then inhale and slowly return the bar to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use a straight bar and grip it with your hands shoulder-width apart, palms facing down. This emphasizes the lateral head of the triceps.
- Lock your upper arms vertically at your sides and move only at the elbow joint. Your shoulders and torso should not move.
- Control the eccentric by letting the bar rise slowly to about a 90-degree elbow angle, no higher, to keep constant tension on the triceps.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the bar come up too high on the return, which releases tension on the triceps and turns the next rep into a momentum-driven push.
- Gripping the bar too tightly, which fatigues the forearms before the triceps. Use a firm but relaxed grip.
- Leaning over the bar and pressing down with body weight rather than isolating the triceps.
