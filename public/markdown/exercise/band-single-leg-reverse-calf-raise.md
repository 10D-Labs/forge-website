## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet hip-width apart and place the band around the ball of your foot.
2. Hold onto a stable object for balance.
3. Slowly raise your heel off the ground, lifting your body weight onto the ball of your foot.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your heel back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch to the other leg.

## Pro tips

- Stand on the edge of a step on one foot and lower your toes below the step level against band resistance.
- Focus on the tibialis anterior (front of the shin) contracting as you raise your toes upward.
- Use a very light band because the tibialis anterior is a small muscle that fatigues fast.

## Common mistakes

- Using too thick a band, which overloads the small tibialis anterior muscle and causes form breakdown.
- Moving too quickly through reps instead of feeling the contraction in the front of the shin.
- Not going through a full range of motion by only lifting the toes a small amount.
