## How to perform

1. Lie on a decline bench with your feet secured and your head lower than your hips.
2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing each other and your arms extended above your chest.
3. Lower the dumbbells to the sides of your chest, keeping your elbows slightly bent.
4. Press the dumbbells back up to the starting position, fully extending your arms.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use a neutral grip (palms facing each other) on the decline bench. This hand position shifts more work to the inner chest and triceps compared to a pronated grip.
- Keep the dumbbells close together throughout the press, maintaining the neutral grip without rotating your wrists.
- Lower the dumbbells to the sides of your lower chest, keeping your elbows at about 45 degrees from your torso.

## Common mistakes

- Rotating the wrists during the press, which changes the exercise from a hammer press to a standard press.
- Letting the dumbbells drift apart at the top, which reduces the inner chest engagement that the neutral grip provides.
- Flaring the elbows too wide, which increases shoulder stress on the decline angle.
