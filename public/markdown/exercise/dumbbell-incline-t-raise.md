## How to perform

1. Set an incline bench to a 45 degree angle and sit on it with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing inwards.
2. Lean forward and let your arms hang straight down, perpendicular to the floor.
3. Keeping your arms straight, raise them out to the sides until they are parallel to the floor, forming a 'T' shape with your body.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your arms back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Raise the dumbbells directly out to the sides, perpendicular to your body, to form a true T shape.
- Lead with your pinkies slightly higher than your thumbs to better target the rear deltoids.
- Pause for 1-2 seconds at the top of each rep and actively squeeze your shoulder blades together.

## Common mistakes

- Shrugging the shoulders up toward the ears, which shifts the work from the mid-back to the upper traps.
- Using momentum to swing the weights up instead of raising them with controlled muscular effort.
- Angling the arms forward instead of straight to the sides, which turns it into more of a Y-raise.

## FAQ

### What's the difference between a T-raise and a Y-raise?

The T-raise lifts the arms straight out to the sides (90 degrees), targeting the rear delts and mid-traps. The Y-raise lifts at a 45-degree angle, targeting the lower traps more.

### How heavy should I go on T-raises?

Very light, typically 3-10 lbs. These target small stabilizer muscles, and going heavy defeats the purpose by recruiting bigger muscles to compensate.

### Can T-raises help with shoulder pain?

They can. Strengthening the rear delts and mid-traps helps balance the shoulder joint and correct the forward-shoulder posture that contributes to impingement.

### What muscles does the Dumbbell Incline T-raise work?

The Dumbbell Incline T-raise primarily targets the shoulders, with secondary activation in the traps, rhomboids. It's classified as a strength exercise for the shoulders.
