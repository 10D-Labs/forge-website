## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand.
2. Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight.
3. Raise your arms out to the sides, keeping a slight bend in your elbows, until they are parallel to the ground.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your arms back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Rest your forehead against a bench or incline pad to stabilize your torso and eliminate any body swing during the raise.
- Raise the dumbbells out to the sides with slightly bent elbows until arms reach parallel, squeezing the rear delts at the top.
- The head support lets you focus entirely on the rear delt contraction without worrying about lower back fatigue.

## Common mistakes

- Lifting the head off the support to generate momentum, which defeats the stability purpose.
- Pulling the dumbbells back toward the hips instead of raising them laterally, changing the exercise to a row pattern.
- Using too much weight and relying on the traps to shrug the dumbbells up instead of using the rear delts.
