## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold the barbell in front of your body with straight arms.
2. Keeping your back straight, lower your body by bending at the knees and hips, as if sitting back into a chair.
3. Continue lowering until your thighs are parallel to the ground, or as low as you can comfortably go.
4. Pause for a moment, then push through your heels to return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hold the barbell in front of you with straight arms, parallel to the floor. This is a front-loaded squat that requires an upright torso.
- Keep your arms perfectly horizontal throughout the squat; if the bar dips, your core is disengaging.
- Descend slowly and maintain a vertical torso. Any forward lean will cause you to lose the bar.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the arms drop during the squat, which means the core is not braced properly and the bar becomes unstable.
- Leaning forward, which shifts the load and defeats the purpose of the Frankenstein position (which is to enforce an upright torso).
- Using too much weight; this exercise is about positioning and core engagement, not maximal loading.
