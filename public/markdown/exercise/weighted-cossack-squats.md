## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart and toes pointing slightly outward.
2. Hold a weight in front of your chest with both hands.
3. Shift your weight to one side and lower your body by bending the knee of the side you shifted towards, while keeping the other leg straight.
4. Go as low as you can while maintaining balance and keeping your chest up.
5. Push through the heel of the bent leg to return to the starting position.
6. Repeat on the other side, alternating between legs.

## Pro tips

- Keep the weight close to your chest (goblet position) to counterbalance your body as you descend to one side.
- Turn the toes of the straight leg upward as you descend to stretch the adductors and protect the knee.
- Only go as deep as your mobility allows with a flat foot on the squatting side.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the heel of the squatting leg come off the ground, which shifts stress to the knee.
- Rounding the back excessively at the bottom instead of keeping the chest up.
- Not going low enough to actually challenge the adductors and hips through their full range.
