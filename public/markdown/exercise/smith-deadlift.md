## How to perform

1. Set up the smith machine with the bar at hip height.
2. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointing slightly outward.
3. Bend at the hips and knees, keeping your back straight and chest up, and grip the bar with an overhand grip slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
4. Engage your core and lift the bar by extending your hips and knees, keeping the bar close to your body.
5. Stand up straight, fully extending your hips and knees.
6. Lower the bar back down by bending at the hips and knees, maintaining control and keeping your back straight.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Position your feet so the bar travels straight up along your shins and thighs; the bar should stay close to your body.
- Initiate the lift by driving through your heels and pushing the floor away rather than pulling with your back.
- Keep your chest up and shoulders back throughout the lift to maintain a neutral spine.

## Common mistakes

- Rounding the lower back during the lift, which is the most common cause of Deadlift-related injuries.
- Standing too far from the bar, which forces you to lean forward and stresses the lower back.
- Hyperextending at the top by leaning back excessively; stop when your hips are fully extended.

Stand with the bar directly over your midfoot, about an inch from your shins. The bar should travel straight up your legs. If you're too far away, the fixed path will pull you forward.
