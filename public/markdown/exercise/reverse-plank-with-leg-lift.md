## How to perform

1. Sit on the ground with your legs extended in front of you and your hands resting on the ground behind you, fingers pointing towards your feet.
2. Press through your hands and lift your hips off the ground, coming into a reverse plank position.
3. Engage your core and lift one leg off the ground, extending it straight up towards the ceiling.
4. Hold for a moment, then lower your leg back down.
5. Repeat with the other leg.
6. Continue alternating legs for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Press your hips up as high as possible before lifting a leg to ensure a strong base position.
- Lift each leg slowly and only as high as you can while keeping your hips level and elevated.
- Point your toes on the lifted leg and squeeze your glute on the supporting side.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the hips sag when lifting a leg, which strains the lower back and reduces glute activation.
- Lifting the leg too high, which causes the hips to rotate and break the straight body line.
- Placing the hands too far behind the body, which puts excessive strain on the wrists and shoulders.
