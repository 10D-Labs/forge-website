## How to perform

1. Lie face down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing inwards.
2. Extend your arms straight down towards the floor, keeping a slight bend in your elbows.
3. Engaging your back muscles, lift the dumbbells up towards your chest, squeezing your shoulder blades together.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Pull the dumbbells wide with elbows flared out to 90 degrees to target the rear delts and upper back rather than the lats.
- Keep your forehead resting on the bench to maintain a neutral spine and prevent neck strain.
- Use light to moderate weight and focus on squeezing the shoulder blades together at the top of each rep.

## Common mistakes

- Tucking the elbows close to the torso, which turns the exercise into a standard row targeting the lats instead of the rear delts.
- Lifting the head and chest off the bench during the row, which introduces momentum and lower back strain.
- Using too much weight and compensating with a shortened range of motion.
