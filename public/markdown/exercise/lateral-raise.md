The lateral raise is a machine-based exercise targeting the deltoid muscles of the shoulders. It involves raising the arms out to the sides against resistance, primarily working the lateral deltoids, with secondary emphasis on the traps and upper back. The machine provides stability, making it accessible for those with less experience. Beginner shoulders exercise using machine. Targets shoulders, also works traps, upper back.

## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height and position yourself on the machine with your back against the pad.
2. Grasp the handles with an overhand grip and keep your arms straight.
3. Exhale and raise your arms out to the sides until they are parallel to the floor.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then inhale and slowly lower your arms back to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Adjust the machine so the pivot point aligns with your shoulder joint, and the pads rest against your outer forearms or elbows.
- Raise your arms to shoulder height (parallel to the floor) and no higher to maximize lateral deltoid engagement without impingement.
- Lower the weight slowly over 3 seconds. The eccentric phase is where much of the muscle-building stimulus occurs.

## Common mistakes

- Shrugging the traps up during the raise instead of keeping shoulders depressed and letting the deltoids do the lifting.
- Raising the arms above shoulder height, which shifts the work to the traps and can cause shoulder impingement.
- Using too much weight and only achieving a partial range of motion.

## FAQ

### Are machine Lateral Raises better than Dumbbell Lateral Raises?

Machine Lateral Raises provide constant tension throughout the range (including the bottom, where dumbbells provide almost no tension). Dumbbells allow a more natural arc. Use both for complete shoulder development.

### How do I target the lateral deltoid specifically?

Lead with your elbows, keep a slight forward lean, and focus on raising your arms directly to the sides. Avoid letting your hands drift forward, which engages the front deltoids.

### What muscles does the Lateral Raise work?

The Lateral Raise primarily targets the shoulders, with secondary activation in the traps, upper back. It's classified as a strength exercise for the shoulders.

### Is the Lateral Raise good for beginners?

Yes, the Lateral Raise is rated as a beginner-level exercise. It's a great starting point for building shoulders strength.
