## How to perform

1. Start by hanging from a pullup bar with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
2. Engage your core and pull your shoulder blades down and back.
3. As you pull yourself up, bend one arm and bring your elbow towards your side, while keeping the other arm straight.
4. Continue pulling until your chin is above the bar and your bent arm is fully flexed.
5. Lower yourself back down with control, straightening the bent arm and repeating the movement on the other side.
6. Alternate sides with each repetition.

## Pro tips

- Use a wide overhand grip and focus on pulling primarily with one arm while the straight arm provides only light assistance.
- Turn the assisting hand so your palm faces the bar, which makes it easier to keep that arm straight.
- Squeeze your working side lat hard at the top and lower with a 3-second eccentric on each rep.

## Common mistakes

- Bending the assisting arm and turning it into a regular Wide Grip Pullup instead of a true archer variation.
- Using a grip that's too narrow, which doesn't allow enough range for the straight arm to extend fully.
- Neglecting the non-dominant side by always starting with the stronger arm.
