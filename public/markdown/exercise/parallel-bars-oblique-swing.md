## How to perform

1. Position yourself on parallel bars with your arms straight and body suspended.
2. Keep your legs together and slightly in front of you.
3. Swing your hips to one side, contracting your obliques.
4. Control the movement as you swing your hips to the opposite side.
5. Continue swinging side to side in a controlled manner for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your legs together and straight throughout the swinging motion for maximum oblique loading.
- Control the swing tempo: 2 seconds to each side with a brief pause at the top of the arc.
- Maintain straight arms with depressed shoulders; don't let yourself sink between the bars.

## Common mistakes

- Swinging wildly with momentum instead of controlling the lateral hip movement with the obliques.
- Bending the legs or knees to make the swing easier, which shortens the lever arm and reduces oblique engagement.
- Letting the shoulders shrug up toward the ears, which causes neck and trap fatigue before the obliques are worked.
