## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold the band with an underhand grip, palms facing up.
2. Keep your elbows close to your sides and slowly curl one arm up towards your shoulder, squeezing your biceps at the top.
3. Lower the arm back down to the starting position and repeat with the other arm.
4. Continue alternating arms for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Step on the center of the band to ensure even resistance for both arms.
- Keep your elbows pinned at your sides and curl one arm fully before starting the other.
- Twist your wrist outward (supinate) at the top of each curl to maximize bicep peak contraction.

## Common mistakes

- Stepping off-center on the band, which creates uneven resistance between the left and right arms.
- Swinging the torso to compensate for band tension instead of keeping the body still.
- Not fully extending the arm at the bottom, performing partial reps that reduce the stretch on the bicep.
