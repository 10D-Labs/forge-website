## How to perform

1. Set up an bench.
2. Place your hands on the bench slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3. Position your feet on the ground, hip-width apart.
4. Lower your chest towards the bench, keeping your elbows tucked in.
5. As you lower, retract your shoulder blades, squeezing your scapulae together.
6. Push through your palms to extend your arms and return to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your arms locked straight; the only movement should be your shoulder blades protracting and retracting.
- At the top, push the floor away as hard as possible, rounding your upper back to fully protract the scapulae.
- The feet-elevated position increases the load on the serratus anterior compared to a flat Scapula Pushup.

## Common mistakes

- Bending the elbows and turning it into a regular Pushup instead of keeping arms straight and moving only the shoulder blades.
- Not achieving full protraction at the top, which shortens the range of motion and reduces serratus anterior activation.
- Sagging the hips, which puts the lower back under stress and takes focus away from the scapular movement.
