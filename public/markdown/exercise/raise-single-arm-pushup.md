## How to perform

1. Start in a pushup position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and your feet together.
2. Extend one arm straight out to the side, parallel to the ground.
3. Lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows, keeping your back straight and core engaged.
4. Push back up to the starting position, using your chest muscles to lift your body.
5. Repeat with the other arm extended.

## Pro tips

- Widen your foot stance significantly for stability when performing the Pushup with one arm extended.
- Keep the extended arm in line with your shoulder, parallel to the ground, throughout the lowering and pressing phases.
- Engage your core aggressively to prevent your body from rotating toward the side of the extended arm.

## Common mistakes

- Not extending the raised arm fully, which reduces the stability challenge and core demand.
- Shifting all the weight onto one side and performing a lopsided Pushup rather than maintaining center balance.
- Holding the breath during the movement due to the difficulty; keep breathing steadily.
