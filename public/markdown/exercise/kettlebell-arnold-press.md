## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a kettlebell in each hand at shoulder height with your palms facing towards you.
2. Engage your core and press the kettlebells overhead, rotating your palms to face forward as you extend your arms.
3. Pause at the top of the movement, then slowly lower the kettlebells back to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Start with palms facing you at shoulder height, then rotate your palms outward as you press overhead. The rotation should be smooth and continuous.
- Finish with the kettlebells directly overhead with biceps near your ears and palms facing forward.
- Use a controlled tempo on the way down, reversing the rotation as the kettlebells return to shoulder height.

## Common mistakes

- Rushing the rotation and pressing before the palms have turned forward, which reduces front deltoid engagement.
- Arching the lower back excessively at the top instead of keeping the core braced and ribcage down.
- Using kettlebells that are too heavy, which causes the form to break down during the rotation phase.
