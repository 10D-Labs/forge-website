## How to perform

1. Set up an incline bench at a 45 degree angle.
2. Sit on the bench with your back against the pad and feet flat on the ground.
3. Hold a barbell with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
4. Lift the barbell up to shoulder height, keeping your elbows slightly bent.
5. Slowly raise the barbell overhead, extending your arms fully.
6. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the barbell back to shoulder height.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Think about pushing the bar toward the ceiling by protracting your shoulder blades (spreading them apart) at the top of each rep to fully engage the serratus anterior.
- Keep the movement slow and controlled; this targets a small muscle group that doesn't need heavy loading.
- Maintain a slight bend in your elbows throughout to reduce joint stress.

## Common mistakes

- Turning the exercise into an overhead press by bending the elbows and pressing instead of using scapular protraction.
- Using too much weight, which causes the traps and deltoids to take over from the serratus.
- Not fully protracting the shoulder blades at the top, missing the peak serratus contraction.

## FAQ

### What does the serratus anterior do?

The serratus anterior protracts and rotates the shoulder blade, which is essential for overhead reaching and pressing. Strong serratus muscles improve shoulder health and overhead stability.

### Why is the serratus important for lifters?

Weak serratus muscles cause winging of the shoulder blade, which leads to shoulder impingement during pressing movements. Strengthening it improves your bench press, overhead press, and reduces injury risk.

### How much weight should I use for this exercise?

Very light, often just 20-40% of your overhead press weight. The serratus is a small muscle; focus on feeling it work rather than moving heavy loads.

### What muscles does the Barbell Incline Shoulder Raise work?

The Barbell Incline Shoulder Raise primarily targets the serratus, with secondary activation in the shoulders, trapezius. It's classified as a strength exercise for the core.

### Is the Barbell Incline Shoulder Raise good for beginners?

The Barbell Incline Shoulder Raise is rated as intermediate. Beginners should build a base of serratus strength with easier variations first.
