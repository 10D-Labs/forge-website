## How to perform

1. Stand in front of a bench or step with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing your body.
2. Place your right foot on the bench or step, ensuring your entire foot is in contact with the surface.
3. Push through your right heel and lift your body up onto the bench or step, straightening your right leg.
4. Bring your left foot up onto the bench or step, standing fully upright.
5. Step back down with your left foot, followed by your right foot, returning to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch legs.

## Pro tips

- Place your entire foot on the bench or step, then drive through the heel to step up, using the working leg to do all the lifting.
- Avoid pushing off with the back foot; the back leg should hang passively while the front leg does all the work.
- Choose a step height where your thigh reaches parallel to the floor at the starting position for optimal glute activation.

## Common mistakes

- Pushing off the ground with the back foot, which assists the working leg and reduces the unilateral training effect.
- Leaning the torso forward excessively, which shifts load to the lower back.
- Using a step that is too low, which limits the range of motion and reduces glute activation.
