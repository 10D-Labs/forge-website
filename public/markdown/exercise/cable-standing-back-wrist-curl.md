## How to perform

1. Stand facing a cable machine with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Hold the cable handle with an overhand grip, palms facing down.
3. Keep your arms straight and your elbows close to your sides.
4. Slowly curl your wrists upward, bringing the cable handle towards your body.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the cable handle back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Stand with your arms at your sides holding the cable behind your back with an overhand grip. Curl only your wrists upward, keeping your arms completely still.
- Use a slow tempo (2 seconds up, 2 seconds down) to maximize time under tension on the wrist extensors.
- Keep your grip firm but not death-gripped. Excessive grip tension fatigues the forearm flexors rather than targeting the extensors.

## Common mistakes

- Bending the elbows to assist the wrist curl, which turns this into a partial Bicep Curl and removes forearm isolation.
- Using too much weight, which limits wrist range of motion to a tiny movement that provides minimal benefit.
- Performing the reps too quickly without pausing at the top contraction.
