## How to perform

1. Hang from a pullup bar with your arms fully extended and your palms facing away from you.
2. Engage your core and lift your legs up in front of you until they are parallel to the ground.
3. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your legs locked out straight and lift by posteriorly tilting your pelvis, not by using hip flexor momentum.
- Pause at the top position (legs parallel) for 1-2 seconds to eliminate any swing and increase time under tension.
- Grip the bar with your hands shoulder-width apart and actively depress your shoulder blades to create a stable hang.

## Common mistakes

- Allowing the knees to bend as fatigue sets in, which reduces the lever length and shifts work away from the abs.
- Swinging the legs forward and back rather than performing slow, controlled raises.
- Failing to engage the pelvis at the top, which means the hip flexors are doing most of the work.
