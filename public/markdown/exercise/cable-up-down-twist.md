## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, facing the cable machine.
2. Hold the cable handle with both hands in front of your chest, keeping your arms slightly bent.
3. Engage your core and slowly rotate your torso to one side, keeping your hips and legs stable.
4. Pause for a moment at the end of the rotation, then slowly return to the starting position.
5. Repeat the rotation to the opposite side.
6. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Anchor your feet wide and keep your hips stable while rotating only through the thoracic spine.
- Pull the cable from a high position to a low position across your body in a diagonal chopping pattern.
- Control the return phase rather than letting the cable snap back to the starting position.

## Common mistakes

- Rotating the hips along with the torso, which takes the work away from the obliques and abs.
- Using too heavy a weight, which makes it impossible to control the rotational movement.
- Bending the arms excessively instead of keeping them extended to maintain the long lever arm.
