## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height so that your hips are slightly higher than your knees.
2. Sit on the machine with your back against the pad and your feet flat on the footrests.
3. Grasp the handles or the sides of the seat for stability.
4. Keeping your back straight, slowly lean forward from your hips until your upper body is parallel to the ground.
5. Pause for a moment, then slowly return to the starting position by pushing through your glutes and hamstrings.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hinge forward from the hips, not by rounding the spine, pushing your chest toward your thighs.
- Keep a slight arch in your lower back throughout the movement to protect the spine.
- Control the descent and use your glutes and hamstrings to pull yourself back upright.

## Common mistakes

- Rounding the lower back at the bottom of the movement, which puts dangerous shear force on the spine.
- Going too deep too quickly before the hamstrings have the flexibility to handle the range of motion.
- Using the machine's assistance to swing up rather than engaging the posterior chain muscles.

Lean forward until you feel a strong stretch in your hamstrings, which is typically when your torso is at about 45-60 degrees from vertical. Don't force depth beyond what your flexibility allows.
