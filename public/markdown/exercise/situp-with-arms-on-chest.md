## Pro tips

- Cross your arms tightly over your chest to prevent using arm momentum to swing yourself up.
- Curl up by engaging your abs first, rolling your spine off the floor one vertebra at a time.
- Lower yourself back down with a slow 3-second count rather than flopping back to the floor.

## Common mistakes

- Anchoring the feet and using hip flexor strength to yank the torso up instead of curling through the abs.
- Throwing the arms forward to generate momentum at the bottom of the movement.
- Performing the movement too quickly and relying on momentum rather than muscular contraction.
