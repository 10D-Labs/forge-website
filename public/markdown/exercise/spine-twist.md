## Pro tips

- Sit tall with your spine lengthened before initiating the twist; imagine growing an inch taller before each rotation.
- Rotate from the thoracic spine (mid-back), not the lower back, to protect the lumbar discs.
- Keep both sit bones firmly planted on the ground throughout the twist to prevent hip shifting.

## Common mistakes

- Rounding the back before twisting, which compresses the spine and limits rotation range.
- Forcing the twist with the arms instead of rotating through the core muscles.
- Lifting one hip off the floor during the rotation, which means the twist is coming from the hips rather than the spine.
