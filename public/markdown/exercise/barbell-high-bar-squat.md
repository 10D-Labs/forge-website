## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly turned out.
2. Place the barbell on your upper back, resting it on your traps.
3. Engage your core and keep your chest up as you begin to squat down, pushing your hips back and bending your knees.
4. Lower yourself until your thighs are parallel to the ground, or as low as you can comfortably go.
5. Drive through your heels to stand back up, extending your hips and knees.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Position the bar on top of your upper traps (not your neck) and maintain a tall, upright torso throughout the movement.
- Push your knees out over your toes and aim for the deepest comfortable depth while keeping your lower back neutral.
- Brace your core hard by taking a deep breath into your belly before each rep and holding it through the sticking point.

## Common mistakes

- Placing the bar on the neck instead of the meaty part of the traps, which causes discomfort and instability.
- Letting the knees cave inward at the bottom of the squat, stressing the knee ligaments.
- Rising onto the toes at the bottom because the ankles lack mobility, which shifts the load forward dangerously.
