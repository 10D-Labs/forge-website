## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointing forward.
2. Place your hands on a stable surface for support, such as a wall or a bar.
3. Lift one leg off the ground, keeping your knee slightly bent.
4. Raise your heel as high as possible, using your calf muscles.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your heel back down.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch legs.

## Pro tips

- Lean forward at the hips to about a 90-degree angle with your torso parallel to the floor, supporting yourself with your hands.
- Let the heel of the working leg drop as low as possible before driving up on the toes for full range.
- Stand on a raised surface to increase the available range of motion at the bottom of the movement.

## Common mistakes

- Not leaning forward enough, which turns it into a regular Standing Calf Raise and changes the muscle emphasis.
- Using the non-working leg to push off the ground subtly, reducing the single-leg challenge.
- Rushing through the bottom stretch instead of pausing to load the calf at its most lengthened position.
