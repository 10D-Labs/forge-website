## How to perform

1. Set up the smith machine with the barbell at an appropriate height for your squat.
2. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly turned out.
3. Position yourself under the barbell, resting it on your upper traps and shoulders.
4. Grip the barbell with a wide grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
5. Engage your core and unrack the barbell, stepping back to clear the rack.
6. Keeping your chest up and back straight, initiate the squat by bending at the hips and knees.
7. Lower your body until your thighs are parallel to the ground or slightly below.
8. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then drive through your heels to return to the starting position.
9. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Position your feet slightly forward of the bar to reduce knee stress and increase glute involvement.
- Keep your core braced and chest up throughout the descent and ascent.
- Descend until your thighs are at least parallel to the floor for complete muscle recruitment.

## Common mistakes

- Placing feet directly under the bar as you would with a free barbell squat, which doesn't account for the fixed path.
- Relying on the machine for balance and using sloppy form that wouldn't translate to free weight squats.
- Not going deep enough; partial squats on the Smith machine develop partial strength.

## FAQ

### Is the Smith machine squat a good exercise?

It's effective for building quad and glute strength, especially for beginners. The fixed path is both a benefit (stability) and a limitation (reduced stabilizer activation). Use it alongside free weight squats for best results.

### Where should I position my feet for Smith Squats?

Place your feet 6-12 inches in front of the bar, shoulder-width apart. This forward position accommodates the fixed bar path and reduces knee shear compared to placing feet directly under the bar.

### Can the Smith Squat replace barbell squats?

It can build leg muscle effectively but doesn't replicate the balance, core stability, and proprioceptive demands of a barbell squat. Use the Smith Squat as a supplement, not a full replacement.

### What muscles does the Smith Squat work?

The Smith Squat primarily targets the glutes, with secondary activation in the quadriceps, hamstrings, calves. It's classified as a strength exercise for the legs.

### Is the Smith Squat good for beginners?

Yes, the Smith Squat is rated as a beginner-level exercise. It's a great starting point for building glutes strength.
