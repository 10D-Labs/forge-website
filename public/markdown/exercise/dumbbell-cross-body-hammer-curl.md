## How to perform

1. Stand up straight with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing your body.
2. Keep your elbows close to your torso and your upper arms stationary.
3. Exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps, bringing the dumbbells across your body towards your opposite shoulder.
4. Continue to raise the dumbbells until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level.
5. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
6. Inhale and slowly begin to lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Curl the dumbbell across your body toward the opposite shoulder rather than straight up. This cross-body path targets the brachialis more than a standard hammer curl.
- Keep your elbow pinned at your side and do not let it drift forward. Only the forearm should move.
- Use a neutral grip (palms facing your body) throughout the entire movement. Do not rotate the wrist.

## Common mistakes

- Curling straight up instead of across the body, which turns this into a standard hammer curl and misses the brachialis emphasis.
- Swinging the body to generate momentum for the cross-body motion.
- Letting the elbow move forward, which uses the front delt to assist the curl.
