## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your hands on your hips.
2. Shift your weight to one leg and lift the opposite leg out to the side, keeping it straight.
3. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your leg back down to the starting position.
4. Repeat on the other side.
5. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your standing leg slightly bent and your core braced to maintain balance throughout the movement.
- Lift the leg directly to the side, not forward or backward, to isolate the hip abductors.
- Control the lowering phase; don't just drop the leg back down.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning the torso excessively to the opposite side to lift the leg higher, which reduces actual abductor engagement.
- Rotating the lifting leg outward (externally rotating the hip) instead of keeping the toes pointed forward.
- Using momentum to swing the leg up instead of a controlled lift.

## FAQ

### Is the standing hip abduction as effective as the machine version?

The standing version also trains balance and core stability, making it more functional. The machine allows for heavier loading. Both effectively target the abductors.

### Should I use a resistance band for standing hip abduction?

A band around the ankles adds resistance throughout the range of motion and is highly recommended once bodyweight becomes easy. It significantly increases glute medius activation.

### How high should I lift my leg?

Lift to about 30-45 degrees from vertical. Going higher usually requires compensating with hip rotation or torso lean, which takes tension off the abductors.

### What muscles does the Side Hip Abduction work?

The Side Hip Abduction primarily targets the abductors, with secondary activation in the glutes, quadriceps. It's classified as a strength exercise for the legs.

### Is the Side Hip Abduction good for beginners?

Yes, the Side Hip Abduction is rated as a beginner-level exercise. It's a great starting point for building abductors strength.
