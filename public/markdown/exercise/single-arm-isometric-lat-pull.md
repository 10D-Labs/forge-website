## How to perform

1. Stand facing a wall with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Raise one arm overhead and place your palm flat against the wall.
3. Keeping your arm straight, attempt to pull your hand downward as if doing a lat pulldown.
4. The wall prevents movement, creating an isometric contraction in your lat.
5. Hold the contraction for 10-30 seconds, then release.
6. Repeat with the other arm.

## Pro tips

- Press your palm into the wall as hard as you can while imagining pulling your elbow down toward your hip.
- Hold for 10-30 seconds per rep and focus on feeling the contraction deep in the lat, not the shoulder.
- Stand about arm's length from the wall with a slight forward lean to align the force vector with the lat fibers.

## Common mistakes

- Pressing with the shoulder and arm muscles instead of engaging the lat, which turns it into a shoulder exercise.
- Holding breath during the isometric contraction instead of breathing steadily.
- Not pressing hard enough to generate meaningful muscle activation.
