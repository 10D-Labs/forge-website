## How to perform

1. Lie flat on a bench with your feet flat on the ground and your head at the end of the bench.
2. Hold the ez barbell with a close grip, palms facing up, and extend your arms straight up over your chest.
3. Keeping your upper arms stationary, slowly lower the barbell behind your head by bending your elbows.
4. Pause for a moment, then extend your arms back up to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Grip the EZ bar on the inner curves with palms facing up (close grip) and extend straight up to start.
- Lower the bar toward the top of your forehead or just behind your head by bending only at the elbows.
- Keep your upper arms angled slightly back (toward your head) rather than perfectly vertical to maintain tension throughout.

## Common mistakes

- Flaring the elbows outward, which turns this into a close-grip press rather than a Tricep Extension.
- Lowering the bar to the nose or chin instead of the forehead, which shortens the range of motion.
- Using momentum to bounce out of the bottom position rather than pressing with controlled tricep force.
