## How to perform

1. Lie flat on a bench with your feet flat on the ground and your head at the end of the bench.
2. Hold a dumbbell with both hands and extend your arms straight up above your chest, palms facing each other.
3. Keeping your upper arms stationary, slowly lower the dumbbell in an arc behind your head until your forearms are parallel to the ground.
4. Pause for a moment, then contract your triceps to bring the dumbbell back to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lower the dumbbell in an arc across your face toward the opposite shoulder rather than straight back, which emphasizes the long head of the triceps.
- Keep your upper arms completely still and perpendicular to the floor so only the forearms move.
- Use a slow, controlled lowering phase to load the triceps in their stretched position, which is key for growth.

## Common mistakes

- Moving the upper arms during the extension, which turns this into a Pullover and removes triceps isolation.
- Lowering the dumbbell too fast, losing control near the face, which is dangerous with this movement path.
- Using too much weight, which forces compensation with the shoulders and reduces the triceps-specific stimulus.
