## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench or chair with your feet flat on the ground and a dumbbell resting on your thighs.
2. Place the balls of your feet on a raised surface such as a step or block, with your heels hanging off the edge.
3. Hold onto the dumbbell for stability.
4. Raise your heels as high as possible, lifting your body weight onto the balls of your feet.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your heels back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Place the balls of your feet on a raised surface (plate or block) so your heels can drop below foot level for a full stretch.
- Position the dumbbell on your thigh just above the knee for maximum leverage on the calf.
- Pause at the very top for 2 seconds and squeeze your calves hard before lowering.

## Common mistakes

- Placing the dumbbell too close to the hip, which reduces the resistance on the calves.
- Using a flat floor with no elevation, which severely limits the range of motion.
- Bouncing the weight at the bottom instead of using a controlled stretch-and-press.
