## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with your feet flat on the ground and a dumbbell in each hand, resting on your thighs.
2. Keep your back straight and core engaged.
3. Raise the dumbbells to your sides with a slight bend in your elbows, until your arms are parallel to the ground.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Sit on the edge of the bench with feet flat, dumbbells at your sides, and raise them laterally to shoulder height with a slight elbow bend.
- Lead with the elbows rather than the hands to keep the emphasis on the lateral deltoid.
- Sit tall and avoid leaning back or side to side during the raise for strict seated isolation.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning back to help swing the dumbbells up, which uses momentum and reduces lateral delt activation.
- Raising the dumbbells too high above shoulder level, shifting the load to the upper traps.
- Using too much weight and compensating with body sway, negating the stability advantage of the seated position.
