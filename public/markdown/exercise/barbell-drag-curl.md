## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a barbell with an underhand grip, palms facing up.
2. Let the barbell hang at arm's length in front of your thighs.
3. Keeping your upper arms stationary, curl the barbell up towards your chest by contracting your biceps.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the barbell back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Drag the bar up along your body by driving your elbows straight back behind you, keeping the bar in contact with your torso the entire time.
- This is not a regular curl; the bar path is vertical along your body, not arced out in front of you.
- Focus on peak contraction at the top and hold for a full second before slowly lowering the bar back down your body.

## Common mistakes

- Performing a regular curl arc instead of keeping the bar against the body, which defeats the purpose of the drag curl.
- Shrugging the shoulders up to help lift the bar instead of keeping the traps relaxed and letting the biceps do the work.
- Using too much weight, which makes it impossible to maintain the bar-to-body contact path.

## FAQ

### What makes drag curls different from regular Barbell Curls?

Drag curls keep the elbows behind the body and the bar against the torso, which emphasizes the long head of the biceps and the brachialis more. Regular curls use an arcing motion with elbows fixed at the sides.

### Why does my bicep peak feel more engaged during drag curls?

The drag curl places the long head of the biceps in a more lengthened position by moving the elbows behind the body. The long head is the outer portion of the bicep responsible for the 'peak' appearance.

### Should I go heavy on drag curls?

No. Use 50-60% of your regular Barbell Curl weight. This is a strict isolation movement that relies on perfect form and mind-muscle connection, not heavy loads.

### What muscles does the Barbell Drag Curl work?

The Barbell Drag Curl primarily targets the biceps, with secondary activation in the forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.

### Is the Barbell Drag Curl good for beginners?

The Barbell Drag Curl is rated as intermediate. Beginners should build a base of biceps strength with easier variations first.
