## How to perform

1. Attach the band to a sturdy anchor point at waist height.
2. Stand facing the anchor point with your feet shoulder-width apart.
3. Hold the band handles with your palms facing each other and your arms extended in front of you.
4. Bend your knees and lower into a squat position, keeping your back straight and chest lifted.
5. From the squat position, pull the band handles towards your body, squeezing your shoulder blades together.
6. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly release the tension and return to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Sink into a full squat first, then row the band handles to your ribcage at the bottom position before standing up.
- Keep your chest lifted throughout and squeeze your shoulder blades together at the peak of the row.
- Maintain band tension even at the starting position by standing far enough from the anchor point.

## Common mistakes

- Rowing before fully squatting down, which turns it into a standing row rather than a combined movement.
- Rounding the upper back during the squat portion, which compromises both the squat and row form.
- Standing too close to the anchor, resulting in no band tension at the start.
