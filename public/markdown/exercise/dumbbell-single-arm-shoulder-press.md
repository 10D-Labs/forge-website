## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell in one hand at shoulder level, palm facing forward.
2. Press the dumbbell upward until your arm is fully extended overhead.
3. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch to the other arm.

## Pro tips

- Brace your core hard to resist the rotational force from pressing with one arm, which turns this into a great core exercise as well.
- Press straight up over the shoulder joint, not across the body, for a clean vertical pressing path.
- Start with your weaker side each set to ensure balanced shoulder development.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning to the opposite side to compensate for the unilateral load, which puts lateral stress on the spine.
- Failing to brace the core, allowing the torso to twist during the press.
- Flaring the elbow out too wide at the start position, which stresses the shoulder joint.
