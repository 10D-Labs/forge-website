## How to perform

1. Stand facing away from the cable machine with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Grab the rope attachment with both hands and step forward, creating tension in the cable.
3. Bend at the hips and lower your upper body until it is parallel to the ground, keeping your back straight.
4. Engage your glutes and hamstrings to pull your body back up to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hinge at the hips with a soft knee bend, pushing your glutes back toward the cable machine. This is a hip hinge, not a squat.
- At the top, drive your hips forward aggressively and squeeze your glutes as hard as possible. Your torso should be completely vertical at lockout.
- Keep the rope between your legs and close to your body. Your arms should stay relaxed and act only as hooks.

## Common mistakes

- Squatting the movement instead of hinging, which turns this into a squat-pull hybrid and removes hamstring and glute emphasis.
- Pulling with the arms or upper back instead of driving the hips forward to move the weight.
- Not standing far enough from the machine, which reduces the range of motion at the bottom of the hinge.
