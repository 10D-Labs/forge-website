## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height and position yourself facing the machine.
2. Grasp the handle with one hand and keep your back straight.
3. Pull the handle towards your body, keeping your elbow close to your side.
4. Squeeze your back muscles at the top of the movement.
5. Slowly release the handle back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Pull the handle toward your upper chest with your elbow traveling up and back to target the upper back and rear delt.
- Keep your non-working hand braced against the machine for stability, but do not use it to assist the pull.
- Rotate your torso slightly toward the working side at the top to achieve a full contraction in the upper back.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling the handle too low (toward the hip), which turns it into a standard lat row rather than a High Row targeting the upper back.
- Using excessive body rotation and momentum to move the weight instead of controlled pulling.
- Not adjusting the seat height properly, which forces an awkward angle on the shoulder.
