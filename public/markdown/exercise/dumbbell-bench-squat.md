## How to perform

1. Place a dumbbell on the ground in front of a bench.
2. Stand facing away from the bench with your feet shoulder-width apart.
3. Bend at the knees and hips to lower yourself down towards the bench, keeping your chest up and back straight.
4. Once your glutes touch the bench, push through your heels to stand back up to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use the bench as a depth gauge. Sit back until your glutes lightly touch the bench, then immediately drive up. Do not fully sit down and rest.
- Hold dumbbells at your sides or at shoulder height. Keep your chest up and core braced throughout the squat.
- Push through your full foot with emphasis on the heels. If your heels come up, the weight is shifting too far forward.

## Common mistakes

- Sitting down fully on the bench and relaxing, which releases muscle tension and requires more force to restart each rep.
- Letting the knees cave inward during the squat, which stresses the knee joint and reduces glute activation.
- Leaning too far forward, which shifts the load from the glutes and quads to the lower back.
