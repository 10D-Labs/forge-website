## How to perform

1. Stand facing a cable machine with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Grasp the cable attachment with an underhand grip, palms facing up, and arms fully extended.
3. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the cable attachment towards your shoulders by contracting your biceps.
4. Pause for a moment at the top of the movement, squeezing your biceps.
5. Inhale and slowly lower the cable attachment back to the starting position, fully extending your arms.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep the bar in contact with your body throughout the curl; it should drag up your torso from hips to chest.
- Pull your elbows back behind your torso as you curl, which is what distinguishes this from a regular curl.
- Focus on squeezing the biceps at the top when your elbows are fully behind you for maximum long-head activation.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the bar drift away from the body, which turns this into a standard Cable Curl and removes the unique bicep stretch.
- Not pulling the elbows far enough behind the torso, which limits the long-head emphasis.
- Using too much weight, which makes it impossible to maintain the drag path against the body.

## FAQ

By pulling the elbows back and keeping the bar against the body, the drag curl shifts emphasis to the long head of the biceps, which is responsible for the bicep peak.

Yes, Barbell Drag Curls are the original version. Cables add constant tension and a smoother resistance curve, but both are effective for long-head bicep development.

### How much weight should I use for Cable Drag Curls?

Start with about 50-60% of your regular Cable Curl weight. The restricted range of motion and strict body contact make this exercise significantly harder than standard curls.
