## How to perform

1. Hang from a pullup bar with your arms fully extended and your palms facing away from you.
2. Engage your core and lift your knees towards your chest, twisting your torso to the side as you do so.
3. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position.
4. Repeat on the other side, twisting your torso in the opposite direction.
5. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hang with a dead-hang grip and lift your knees toward one armpit, then alternate to the other side.
- Focus on rotating the pelvis, not just swinging the knees; you should feel the obliques contract to drive the twist.
- Avoid swinging by pausing briefly at the bottom between reps to reset and eliminate momentum.

## Common mistakes

- Using momentum to swing the legs rather than lifting with controlled oblique and hip flexor contraction.
- Not rotating enough, which turns this into a standard knee raise with minimal oblique involvement.
- Gripping too tightly and tensing the shoulders, which leads to early grip fatigue.
