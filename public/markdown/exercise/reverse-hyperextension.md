## How to perform

1. Adjust the machine to fit your body and secure your feet in the foot pads.
2. Lie face down on the machine with your upper body hanging off the edge and your hips resting on the pad.
3. Cross your arms over your chest or place them behind your head.
4. Engage your glutes and hamstrings to lift your legs upward until they are parallel to the ground.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Anchor your upper body firmly and let your legs hang below the pad at the start. Lift them by squeezing your glutes, not swinging.
- Raise your legs until they're in line with your torso (parallel to the ground), then hold for 1-2 seconds.
- Lower your legs slowly. The eccentric phase decompresses the spine, which is one of the unique benefits of this exercise.

## Common mistakes

- Swinging the legs up with momentum instead of lifting with controlled glute contraction.
- Hyperextending at the top by lifting the legs too high above the body line, which compresses the lumbar spine.
- Not going through the full range of motion by only partially lifting the legs.
