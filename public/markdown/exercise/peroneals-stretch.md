## How to perform

1. Sit on the ground with your legs extended in front of you.
2. Loop the rope around the ball of your foot and hold the ends of the rope with your hands.
3. Gently pull the rope towards you, flexing your foot and stretching your calf muscles.
4. Hold the stretch for 15-30 seconds.
5. Release the tension on the rope and repeat the stretch on the other leg.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Pull the band or rope so that your foot inverts (sole turning inward) to specifically target the peroneal muscles on the outer calf and ankle.
- Hold for 20-30 seconds with gentle, steady tension rather than pulling aggressively.
- Keep your knee straight to stretch the full length of the peroneal muscles.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling the foot straight back (dorsiflexion) instead of inverting it, which stretches the gastrocnemius rather than the peroneals.
- Applying too much force too quickly, which can strain the outer ankle ligaments.
- Bending the knee during the stretch, which shortens the muscle and reduces the stretch intensity.
