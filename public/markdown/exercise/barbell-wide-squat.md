## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, toes pointing slightly outward.
2. Hold the barbell across your upper back, resting it on your traps or rear delts.
3. Engage your core and keep your chest up as you lower your body down into a squat, pushing your hips back and bending your knees.
4. Lower until your thighs are parallel to the ground, or as low as you can comfortably go.
5. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push through your heels to return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Set your feet 1.5-2 times shoulder width with toes turned out 30-45 degrees to allow the hips to open fully.
- Push your knees out over your toes throughout the entire squat, especially at the bottom.
- The wider stance recruits more adductors and glutes, so expect to feel the inner thighs working.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the knees collapse inward on the ascent, which stresses the knee ligaments and reduces power output.
- Not turning the toes out enough for the stance width, which restricts hip depth and forces the knees forward.
- Going too wide to the point where your hips lack the mobility to reach proper depth.

## FAQ

### Does a wide squat stance work different muscles than a regular stance?

Yes. Wide stance squats recruit more adductors (inner thigh) and glutes, while regular stance squats emphasize the quadriceps more. Both work all the leg muscles but in different proportions.

### How wide is too wide for squats?

If your hips can't reach parallel depth or your knees collapse inward, the stance is too wide for your current mobility. Widen the stance gradually as hip mobility improves.

### Is the wide squat better for glute development?

The wider stance does engage the glutes more, particularly the gluteus medius. However, hip thrusts and lunges are generally more effective for isolated glute growth. Wide squats are best as a compound movement variation.

### What muscles does the Barbell Wide Squat work?

The Barbell Wide Squat primarily targets the quads, with secondary activation in the glutes, hamstrings, calves. It's classified as a strength exercise for the legs.

### Is the Barbell Wide Squat good for beginners?

The Barbell Wide Squat is rated as intermediate. Beginners should build a base of quads strength with easier variations first.
