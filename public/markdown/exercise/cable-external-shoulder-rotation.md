## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent.
2. Hold the cable handle with your arm extended in front of you, parallel to the ground.
3. Keep your elbow slightly bent and your shoulder blades pulled back.
4. Slowly rotate your arm outward, away from your body, while keeping your elbow in the same position.
5. Pause for a moment at the end of the movement, then slowly return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your elbow bent at 90 degrees and pinned to your side. Rotate your forearm outward, away from your body, using only the rotator cuff muscles.
- Use very light weight (2-5 lbs). This is a prehab exercise targeting the infraspinatus and teres minor, not a strength movement.
- Place a rolled towel between your elbow and torso to maintain proper arm position and prevent the elbow from drifting.

## Common mistakes

- Using too much weight, which causes the body to compensate by rotating the trunk or shrugging the shoulder.
- Letting the elbow pull away from the torso during the rotation, which changes the axis of rotation and reduces rotator cuff isolation.
- Performing the reps too quickly without controlling the return phase, which misses the eccentric strengthening benefit.
