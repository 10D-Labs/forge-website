## How to perform

1. Attach the band to a stationary object at chest height.
2. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold the band with both hands in front of you.
3. Keep your arms straight and lift them out to the sides until they are parallel to the ground.
4. Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.
5. Slowly lower your arms back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hold the band at chest height with arms extended and pull the band apart by squeezing your shoulder blades together.
- Keep a slight bend in the elbows and focus on the rear delts doing the work.
- Hold the fully opened position for a one-second pause to maximize rear delt contraction.

## Common mistakes

- Bending the elbows too much, which shortens the lever arm and makes the exercise easier, reducing rear delt work.
- Shrugging the shoulders up toward the ears instead of keeping them depressed and retracted.
- Using a band that is too thick, which prevents full range of motion.

3-4 times per week as part of your warmup or between sets of pressing exercises. They require minimal recovery and benefit from high frequency.
