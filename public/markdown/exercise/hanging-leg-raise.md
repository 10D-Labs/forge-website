## How to perform

1. Hang from a pullup bar with your arms fully extended and your palms facing away from you.
2. Engage your core and lift your legs up in front of you, keeping them straight.
3. Continue lifting until your legs are parallel to the ground or as high as you can comfortably go.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Initiate the movement by tilting your pelvis (posterior Pelvic Tilt) before lifting your legs to engage the abs from the start.
- Avoid swinging by pausing for one second at the bottom of each rep before starting the next one.
- Squeeze your legs together and point your toes to create a longer lever and increase difficulty.

## Common mistakes

- Using momentum from swinging the body rather than controlled ab engagement to raise the legs.
- Only lifting the legs to 90 degrees without curling the pelvis up, which works the hip flexors more than the abs.
- Losing grip before the abs are fatigued. If grip fails first, use ab straps to hang from your elbows.

## FAQ

### Do Hanging Leg Raises work the lower abs?

Yes, they are one of the most effective lower ab exercises because the movement involves bottom-up spinal flexion. The key is to curl your pelvis upward at the top, not just lift your legs.

### Should I do Hanging Leg Raises with straight or bent legs?

Straight legs are harder and provide more overload. If you can't control the movement with straight legs, start with bent knees and progress as you get stronger.

The Hanging Leg Raise primarily targets the abs, with secondary activation in the hip flexors. It's classified as a strength exercise for the core.

### Is the Hanging Leg Raise good for beginners?

The Hanging Leg Raise is an advanced exercise. Beginners should master fundamental core movements first.
