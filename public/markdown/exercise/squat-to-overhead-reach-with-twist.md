## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and toes slightly turned out.
2. Lower your body into a squat position by bending your knees and pushing your hips back.
3. As you come up from the squat, raise your arms overhead and twist your torso to one side.
4. Return to the starting position and repeat the squat, this time twisting your torso to the opposite side.
5. Continue alternating sides with each squat repetition.

## Pro tips

- Twist from the thoracic spine (mid-back), not the lower back, as you reach overhead and rotate.
- Alternate the twist direction with each squat rep to mobilize both sides of the spine equally.
- Follow your reaching hand with your eyes to maximize the rotational range of motion.

## Common mistakes

- Twisting from the lumbar spine instead of the thoracic spine, which can strain the lower back.
- Losing depth in the squat as fatigue sets in; maintain consistent squat depth throughout the set.
- Not rotating enough, performing a minimal twist that misses the thoracic mobility benefit.
