## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height and position yourself on the machine with your chest against the pad and your feet flat on the ground.
2. Grasp the handles with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3. Keep your back straight and your core engaged as you pull the handles towards your chest, squeezing your shoulder blades together.
4. Pause for a moment at the top of the movement, then slowly release the handles back to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Pull with your elbows high and wide (at shoulder level) to target the rear delts rather than the lats.
- Keep your chest pressed against the pad to isolate the rear delts and prevent cheating with momentum.
- Use a lighter weight than standard rows; the rear delts are small muscles that fatigue quickly.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling with low elbows (toward the waist), which turns it into a lat-dominant row.
- Using too much weight and pulling with the biceps and traps instead of the rear delts.
- Leaning back off the chest pad to generate momentum on heavier sets.
