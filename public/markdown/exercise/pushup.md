## How to perform

1. Start in a high plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and your feet together.
2. Engage your core and lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows, keeping your body in a straight line.
3. Pause for a moment when your chest is just above the ground, then push yourself back up to the starting position by straightening your arms.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Position your hands directly under your shoulders or slightly wider, with fingers spread for a stable base.
- Keep your elbows at a 45-degree angle to your torso, not flared out at 90 degrees, to protect your shoulders.
- Squeeze your glutes and brace your abs to maintain a rigid plank from head to heels throughout every rep.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the hips sag toward the floor (the 'banana back'), which strains the lower back and reduces chest engagement.
- Only going halfway down instead of lowering until the chest is just above the ground.
- Flaring the elbows out to 90 degrees, which puts excessive stress on the shoulder joint.
