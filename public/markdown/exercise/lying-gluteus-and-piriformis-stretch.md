## How to perform

1. Lie on your back with your legs extended.
2. Bend your right knee and place your right ankle on your left thigh, just above the knee.
3. Grasp your left thigh with both hands and gently pull it towards your chest.
4. Hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds.
5. Release the stretch and repeat on the other side.

## Pro tips

- Gently press the knee of the crossed leg away from your body with your elbow to increase the piriformis stretch.
- Keep both hips level on the ground; don't let one side lift as you pull the leg closer.
- Hold the stretch steadily without bouncing to allow the deep rotator muscles to release.

## Common mistakes

- Forcing the stretch too aggressively, which can irritate the piriformis rather than relax it.
- Allowing the lower back to arch off the ground as you pull the leg closer.
- Rushing through the hold; the piriformis is a deep muscle that requires 30+ seconds of sustained stretch to release.
