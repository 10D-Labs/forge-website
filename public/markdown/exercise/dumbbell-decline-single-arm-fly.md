## How to perform

1. Lie down on a decline bench with a dumbbell in one hand, resting it on your thigh.
2. Using your thigh to help raise the dumbbell, lift it up to shoulder width with your palm facing your torso.
3. Rotate your wrist so that the palm of your hand is facing forward.
4. As you breathe in, lower the dumbbell slowly to the side until you feel a stretch in your chest.
5. Exhale and use your chest muscles to bring the dumbbell back up to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch arms.

## Pro tips

- Brace your free hand against the bench or your thigh for stability since the single-arm load creates a rotational force.
- Lower the dumbbell in a wide arc until you feel a deep stretch in the lower chest, then squeeze it back to the top.
- Keep a slight bend in the elbow locked throughout and avoid turning the fly into a press.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the torso rotate toward the working arm instead of keeping the chest square to the ceiling.
- Lowering the dumbbell too far, which puts the shoulder in a vulnerable position under load.
- Straightening the elbow at the bottom, which turns the fly into a Pullover and stresses the elbow joint.

## FAQ

### Why do single arm decline flys instead of bilateral?

Single arm work addresses muscle imbalances, increases core engagement due to the anti-rotation demand, and allows slightly greater range of motion per side.

### What part of the chest does a decline fly target?

The decline angle emphasizes the lower (sternal) fibers of the pectoralis major. Adding the fly pattern isolates the chest without tricep involvement.

### How much weight should you use?

Significantly less than a bilateral fly. Start with 50-60% of what you would use for a two-arm decline fly and increase gradually as you build stability.

The Dumbbell Decline Single Arm Fly primarily targets the chest, with secondary activation in the shoulders. It's classified as a strength exercise for the chest.
