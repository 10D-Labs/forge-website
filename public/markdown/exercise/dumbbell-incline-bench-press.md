## Pro tips

- Set the bench at 30-45 degrees. Lower the dumbbells to the sides of your upper chest, just below the collarbone, to target the upper pec fibers.
- Retract and depress your shoulder blades into the bench before pressing. This stabilizes the shoulder joint and increases chest engagement.
- Press the dumbbells up and slightly inward so they converge at the top above your upper chest.

## Common mistakes

- Setting the bench angle too high (above 45 degrees), which turns this into a shoulder press rather than an upper Chest Press.
- Letting the dumbbells drift over the lower chest or belly during the press, which negates the incline angle.
- Not retracting the shoulder blades, which destabilizes the shoulders and reduces chest involvement.
