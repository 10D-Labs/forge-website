## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height and foot platform to a comfortable position.
2. Sit on the machine with your chest against the pad and your feet flat on the foot platform.
3. Grasp the handles with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
4. Keep your back straight and engage your core.
5. Pull the handles towards your body, squeezing your shoulder blades together.
6. Pause for a moment at the peak of the movement, then slowly release the handles back to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Pull the handles toward your upper chest with your elbows flaring slightly outward to target the upper back and rear deltoids.
- Keep your chest firmly pressed against the pad throughout the movement to prevent using body momentum.
- Hold the peak contraction for 1-2 seconds, actively squeezing your shoulder blades together.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling too low (toward the waist), which turns this into a standard row targeting the lats instead of the upper back.
- Leaning away from the pad to use momentum, which defeats the isolation purpose of the machine.
- Using too much weight and performing partial reps that don't achieve a full shoulder blade squeeze.
