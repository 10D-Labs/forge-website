## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with your feet flat on the ground and hold a dumbbell in one hand.
2. Bend your torso forward at the waist, keeping your back straight and parallel to the ground.
3. Extend your arm straight back, keeping your elbow close to your body.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch arms.

## Pro tips

- Lean your torso forward while seated and brace your non-working hand on the bench for stability.
- Lock the upper arm parallel to the floor and extend only from the elbow to isolate the triceps completely.
- Hold the fully extended position for a one-count squeeze before lowering to maximize the peak contraction.

## Common mistakes

- Not leaning forward enough, which reduces the range of motion where the triceps are under load.
- Swinging the entire arm from the shoulder rather than isolating the movement to elbow extension.
- Rushing through reps without holding the extended position, missing the most effective part of the exercise.
