5. Pause for a moment at the top, squeezing your biceps.
6. Inhale and slowly lower the ez barbell back to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Sit upright with your back flat against the bench to eliminate momentum and keep all the tension on your biceps.
- Use the inner angled grips of the EZ bar to reduce wrist strain while still getting full bicep contraction.
- Lower the bar slowly for a 3-second eccentric to maximize muscle fiber recruitment on every rep.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning back and using your torso to swing the bar up, which takes tension off the biceps.
- Letting the elbows drift forward during the curl, which shifts work to the front deltoids.
- Cutting the range of motion short by not fully extending the arms at the bottom of each rep.
