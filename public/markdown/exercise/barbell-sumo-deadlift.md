## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, toes pointing outwards.
2. Place a barbell on the ground in front of you, centered between your feet.
3. Bend your knees and lower your hips, keeping your back straight and chest up, to grip the barbell with an overhand grip.
4. Engage your core and drive through your heels to lift the barbell off the ground, extending your hips and knees simultaneously.
5. As you lift, keep your chest up and back straight, and push your hips forward to fully engage your glutes.
6. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the barbell back down to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the movement.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Set up with your feet wider than shoulder width (1.5-2x), toes turned out 30-45 degrees, and grip the bar inside your knees.
- Push your knees out over your toes as you initiate the pull, and drive your hips forward to lock out.
- Keep your chest up and arms straight; the wider stance shortens the range of motion, so use this to your advantage.

## Common mistakes

- Setting up with the hips too high, which negates the quad involvement that makes sumo Deadlift unique.
- Letting the knees cave inward during the pull, which stresses the knee ligaments and reduces power.
- Not pushing the hips through at the top, leaving the lockout incomplete.
