3. As you reach the bottom of the squat, explosively drive through your legs and push the barbell overhead.
4. As the barbell reaches its peak, quickly drop into a split position, with one foot forward and one foot back.
5. Catch the barbell overhead with your arms fully extended and your back knee slightly touching the ground.
