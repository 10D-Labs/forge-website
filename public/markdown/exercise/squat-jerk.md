## How to perform

1. Start with the barbell resting on your shoulders, with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Lower your body into a squat position, keeping your chest up and your knees tracking over your toes.
3. As you reach the bottom of the squat, explosively drive through your legs and push the barbell overhead.
4. As the barbell reaches its peak, quickly drop into a split position, with one foot forward and one foot back.
5. Catch the barbell overhead with your arms fully extended and your back knee slightly touching the ground.
6. Stand up from the split position, bringing your feet back together.
7. Lower the barbell back to your shoulders and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Dip straight down with the knees before the drive; any forward lean will send the bar forward.
- Receive the bar in a deep overhead squat position with active shoulders pressing up against the bar.
- Drive the bar off your shoulders with maximum leg power; the stronger the drive, the less you need to press.

## Common mistakes

- Dipping forward instead of straight down, which sends the bar forward and out of position.
- Not committing to the full depth overhead squat catch, resulting in receiving the bar on bent arms.
- Pressing the bar with the arms instead of using the leg drive to get the bar to lockout.
