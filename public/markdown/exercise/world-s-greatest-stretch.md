## How to perform

1. Start in a lunge position with your right foot forward and your left foot back.
2. Place your hands on the ground on either side of your right foot.
3. Lower your left knee to the ground and extend your right leg, keeping your right foot flat on the ground.
4. Rotate your torso to the right, reaching your right arm up towards the ceiling.
5. Hold this position for a few seconds, then return to the starting position.
6. Switch sides and repeat the stretch with your left foot forward.

## Pro tips

- In the lunge position, drive your front knee out over your pinky toe to open the hip and maximize the groin stretch.
- When rotating and reaching toward the ceiling, follow your hand with your eyes to increase the thoracic spine rotation.
- Keep the back leg active by squeezing the glute and quad to deepen the hip flexor stretch on that side.

## Common mistakes

- Rushing through the sequence instead of holding each position for 2-3 breaths to get a meaningful stretch.
- Not rotating the torso enough during the reach, which misses the thoracic mobility benefit.
- Letting the front knee cave inward during the lunge, reducing the hip opening.
