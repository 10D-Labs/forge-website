## How to perform

1. Start by hanging from a bar with your arms fully extended and your body relaxed.
2. Engage your core and lift your legs up, bringing your knees towards your chest.
3. Continue to lift your legs up and over your head, allowing your body to pass through the arms.
4. Once your legs are fully extended over your head, begin to lower them back down towards the starting position.
5. As you lower your legs, allow your body to pass back through the arms until you are hanging with your arms fully extended again.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Move through the rotation slowly and under control, taking 3-4 seconds to pass through each phase.
- Engage your lats and core throughout the rotation rather than letting gravity pull you through.
- Start with bent knees to shorten the lever arm and reduce the shoulder stretch at the bottom.

## Common mistakes

- Dropping through the movement with momentum instead of controlling the rotation, which can strain the shoulder capsule.
- Going too deep into the German hang position before your shoulders have the mobility to handle it.
- Letting go of the bar or rings at the bottom position due to grip fatigue, which can result in a fall.
