## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and hold a kettlebell in each hand with your palms facing your body.
2. Bend forward at the hips, keeping your back straight and your core engaged.
3. Pull the kettlebells up towards your chest, squeezing your shoulder blades together.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the kettlebells back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hinge at the hips until your torso is about 45 degrees to the floor, and maintain this angle throughout the set.
- Grip the kettlebell handles with a neutral grip and pull them toward your hip creases, not your chest.
- Squeeze your shoulder blades together hard at the top and hold for a beat before lowering.

## Common mistakes

- Standing too upright, which turns the row into a shrug-like movement instead of a back exercise.
- Rounding the lower back to reach the starting position instead of hinging properly at the hips.
- Swinging the kettlebells to build momentum rather than pulling with controlled back engagement.
