## How to perform

1. Attach a single handle to a high pulley cable machine.
2. Stand facing the machine with your feet shoulder-width apart.
3. Grasp the handle with an overhand grip and extend your arm fully.
4. Keep your back straight and your core engaged.
5. Pull the handle down towards your side while keeping your elbow close to your body.
6. Pause for a moment at the bottom of the movement, squeezing your lat muscle.
7. Slowly release the handle back to the starting position.
8. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
9. Switch sides and repeat the exercise with the other arm.

## Pro tips

- Keep your torso upright and avoid rotating toward the pulling arm to isolate the working lat.
- Pull your elbow down and back toward your hip pocket, not straight down, to maximize lat contraction.
- Use a 2-second squeeze at the bottom of each rep before slowly releasing back to full extension.

## Common mistakes

- Rotating the torso toward the working arm, which recruits the obliques and reduces lat isolation.
- Using too much weight and leaning back excessively, turning it into a rowing motion instead of a pulldown.
- Not fully extending the arm at the top of each rep, which shortens the range of motion.

## FAQ

### Why use single-arm pulldowns instead of two-arm?

Single-arm work addresses strength imbalances between sides, increases range of motion since you can pull further, and allows you to focus on the mind-muscle connection with each lat individually.

### What grip should I use?

A neutral grip (palm facing inward) or an underhand grip both work well. Neutral grip tends to feel more natural on the shoulder joint.

### Where should I stand relative to the cable?

Stand directly in front of the high pulley, about one step back. This angle allows the cable to travel in a straight line along your lat's natural pulling path.

### What muscles does the Cable Single Arm Pulldown work?

The Cable Single Arm Pulldown primarily targets the lats, with secondary activation in the biceps, forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the back.
