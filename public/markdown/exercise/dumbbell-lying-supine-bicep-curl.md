## How to perform

1. Lie flat on a bench with your back and head supported, and your feet flat on the ground.
2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing up and your arms fully extended.
3. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps.
4. Continue to raise the weights until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level.
5. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
6. Inhale and slowly begin to lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Let your arms hang straight down from your shoulders before curling to get a full stretch at the bottom.
- Press your back and head into the bench throughout the set to prevent arching or lifting.
- Curl both dumbbells simultaneously and squeeze hard at the top.

## Common mistakes

- Arching the back off the bench to generate momentum, which defeats the purpose of lying down for strict form.
- Not fully extending the arms between reps, which limits the range of motion.
- Curling too fast without controlling the eccentric, missing the muscle-building benefit of the negative.
