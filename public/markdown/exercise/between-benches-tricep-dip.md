## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with your hands gripping the edge of the bench, fingers pointing forward.
2. Slide your butt off the bench, supporting your weight with your hands.
3. Bend your elbows and lower your body towards the ground, keeping your back close to the bench.
4. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push yourself back up to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Set the two benches at a distance where your legs are fully extended but not hyperextended at the knees.
- Keep your torso upright and close to the rear bench to keep tension on the triceps rather than the chest.
- Grip the edge of the bench firmly with fingers curling over and pointing forward for the most stable base.

## Common mistakes

- Placing the benches too far apart, which causes the hips to sag and reduces tricep engagement.
- Shrugging the shoulders up toward the ears instead of keeping them depressed and packed.
- Using momentum to bounce out of the bottom position instead of pressing with control.
