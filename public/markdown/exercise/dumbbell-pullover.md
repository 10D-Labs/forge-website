## How to perform

1. Lie flat on a bench with your head at one end and your feet planted firmly on the ground.
2. Hold a dumbbell with both hands and extend your arms straight above your chest.
3. Keeping your arms straight, slowly lower the dumbbell behind your head in an arc-like motion.
4. Pause for a moment, then raise the dumbbell back to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lie with your upper back across the bench and lower the dumbbell behind your head in a wide arc until you feel a deep stretch in the chest and lats.
- Keep a slight bend in your elbows throughout and think about pulling the weight back over with your chest, not your arms.
- Brace your core and keep your hips steady; do not let them rise or fall during the Pullover arc.

## Common mistakes

- Bending the elbows excessively and turning the Pullover into a Tricep Extension movement.
- Lowering the hips as the dumbbell goes behind the head, which reduces the stretch on the chest and lats.
- Dropping the dumbbell too far behind the head, which can strain the shoulder capsule.

## FAQ

Both. The initial pull from the stretched position uses the chest, while the lats assist throughout. Emphasis depends on your mind-muscle focus and elbow position.
