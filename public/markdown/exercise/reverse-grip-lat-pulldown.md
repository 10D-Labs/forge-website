## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height and position yourself on the machine with your knees under the pads and your feet flat on the ground.
2. Grasp the handles with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3. Sit upright with your chest out and shoulders back, maintaining a slight arch in your lower back.
4. Pull the handles down towards your chest, leading with your elbows and squeezing your shoulder blades together.
5. Pause for a moment at the bottom of the movement, then slowly release the handles back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use an underhand (supinated) grip slightly narrower than shoulder width to maximize bicep and lower lat involvement.
- Pull the bar to your upper chest while arching your upper back slightly and lifting your chest.
- Focus on driving your elbows straight down and behind you rather than pulling the bar with your hands.

## Common mistakes

- Gripping too wide with a reverse grip, which puts the wrists in an uncomfortable position and reduces bicep activation.
- Leaning back excessively to pull the weight, which turns the pulldown into a body-english row.
- Not achieving a full stretch at the top by keeping tension in the arms instead of fully extending overhead.
