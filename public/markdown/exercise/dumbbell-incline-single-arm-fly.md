1. Adjust the incline bench to a 30-45 degree angle.
2. Sit on the bench with a dumbbell in one hand, resting it on your thigh.
3. Lie back on the bench, keeping your feet flat on the ground.
4. Hold the dumbbell with your arm extended straight up over your chest.
5. Lower the dumbbell out to the side in a wide arc, keeping a slight bend in your elbow.
6. Pause when your arm is parallel to the ground, then reverse the motion to bring the dumbbell back to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch arms.

## Pro tips

- Brace your free hand against the bench or your torso to prevent your body from rotating during the arc.
- Keep a consistent 15-20 degree bend in your elbow throughout the entire fly motion to protect the shoulder joint.
- Lower the dumbbell until your upper arm is roughly parallel with the floor, not deeper, to avoid overstretching the pec tendon.

- Letting the torso twist toward the working arm instead of keeping the chest square to the ceiling.
- Turning the fly into a press by bending the elbow excessively at the bottom of the movement.
- Using momentum to swing the dumbbell back up instead of controlling the arc with the chest.
