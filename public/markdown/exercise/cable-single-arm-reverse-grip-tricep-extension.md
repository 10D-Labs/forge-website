## Pro tips

- Face away from the machine and hold the handle with an underhand (supinated) grip overhead.
- Keep your upper arm close to your head and extend the forearm forward by straightening the elbow.
- Control the return slowly; the overhead reverse grip creates an excellent stretch on the long head.

- Letting the elbow drift away from the head, which reduces the stretch on the tricep long head.
- Arching the lower back under the overhead load instead of bracing the core.
- Using too much weight, which forces compensatory movement through the shoulder joint.
