## How to perform

2. Hold the kettlebell in one hand with your palm facing towards your feet and your arm extended straight up towards the ceiling.
3. Slowly lower the kettlebell towards your chest by bending your elbow, keeping your upper arm close to your body.

5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch to the other arm.

## Pro tips

- Let your elbow touch the floor gently at the bottom of each rep to establish a consistent range of motion.
- Keep the kettlebell handle diagonal across your palm so the bell rests on the back of your forearm, reducing wrist strain.
- Bend the non-working side knee and plant that foot flat to stabilize your hips during the press.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the elbow flare out to 90 degrees instead of keeping it at about 45 degrees from the torso.
- Bouncing the elbow off the floor to generate momentum rather than pressing from a dead stop.
- Gripping the handle too tightly with the wrist cocked back, which fatigues the forearm prematurely.
