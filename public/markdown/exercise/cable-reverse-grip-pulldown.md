## How to perform

1. Sit on the seat facing the cable machine with your feet flat on the floor.
2. Grasp the cable attachment with an underhand grip, palms facing up, and your hands shoulder-width apart.
3. Keep your back straight and lean slightly forward from your hips.
4. Pull the cable towards your torso by retracting your shoulder blades and squeezing your back muscles.
5. Pause for a moment at the peak of the contraction, then slowly release the cable back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use a shoulder-width underhand grip. This supinated position shifts emphasis to the lower lats and increases bicep involvement compared to an overhand pulldown.
- Pull the bar toward your lower chest while arching your upper back slightly to maximize the contraction in the lower lat fibers.
- Squeeze your lats at the bottom for a full second before slowly releasing the bar back to the top.

## Common mistakes

- Gripping too wide with an underhand grip, which places excessive stress on the wrists and limits range of motion.
- Leaning too far back, which turns the pulldown into a row and reduces the vertical pull angle needed for lat development.
- Relying on the biceps to pull the weight rather than initiating the movement with shoulder blade depression.
