## How to perform

1. Adjust the bench to a 45 degree incline.
2. Lie face down on the bench with your chest and stomach resting against it.
3. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing down and your arms fully extended.
4. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps.
5. Continue to raise the weights until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level.
6. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
7. Inhale and slowly begin to lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
8. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lie face down on the incline bench with your arms hanging straight down, which eliminates any ability to use momentum or body swing.
- Curl the dumbbells up while keeping your upper arms perfectly vertical, squeezing the biceps at the top.
- Use a 3-second lowering phase to fully exploit the stretched position that this prone incline angle creates.

## Common mistakes

- Lifting the chest off the bench to swing the weight up, which defeats the strict isolation purpose of the prone position.
- Not lowering the dumbbells all the way to full arm extension, which shortens the most beneficial part of the range of motion.
- Using the same weight as standing curls; you will need to go lighter due to the strict positioning.
