## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, toes pointing slightly outward.
2. Hold a barbell across your upper back, resting it on your traps.
3. Engage your core and keep your chest up as you lower your body down into a squat position, bending at the knees and hips.
4. As you lower, push your knees out to the sides and keep your weight on your heels.
5. Lower until your thighs are parallel to the ground, then push through your heels to return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use a wide stance (1.5-2 times shoulder width) with toes pointed out at 30-45 degrees.
- Shift your weight to one leg as you descend, bending that knee while keeping the other leg straighter.
- Push your hips back and keep your chest up as you lower into the split position.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the working knee collapse inward instead of tracking over the toes.
- Not going deep enough; aim to get the working thigh at least parallel to the ground.
- Rounding the upper back because the wide stance feels unnatural with a barbell.
