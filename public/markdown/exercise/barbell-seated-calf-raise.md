## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with your feet flat on the floor and a barbell resting on your thighs.
2. Place the balls of your feet on a raised platform, such as a block or step.
3. Position the barbell across your thighs and hold it securely with your hands.
4. Keeping your back straight and your core engaged, lift your heels off the ground by extending your ankles.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your heels back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Place the balls of your feet on a raised surface so your heels can drop below the platform for a full stretch at the bottom.
- Push through the big toe side of your foot and hold the peak contraction for 2 seconds at the top of each rep.
- Use a slow tempo (2 seconds up, 2-second hold, 3 seconds down) since calves respond well to time under tension.

## Common mistakes

- Bouncing at the bottom of each rep, using the stretch reflex instead of muscular force.
- Not using a raised surface for the feet, which limits the range of motion and reduces the stretch stimulus.
- Using too much weight and only performing partial reps through the middle range.

## FAQ

### Do Seated Calf Raises work the same muscles as Standing Calf Raises?

Not exactly. Seated Calf Raises primarily target the soleus (the deeper, wider calf muscle) because the bent knee reduces gastrocnemius involvement. Standing Calf Raises hit both the gastrocnemius and soleus.

### How often should I train calves?

Calves recover quickly and can be trained 3-4 times per week. High frequency with moderate volume (4-6 sets per session) tends to produce the best calf growth.

### Why don't my calves grow?

Calves are stubborn because they're used all day for walking. They need higher volume, higher frequency, full range of motion, and slow controlled reps to grow. Most people use too much weight and too little range.
