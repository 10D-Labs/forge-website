## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing forward.
2. Keep your elbows close to your torso and exhale as you curl the weights up to shoulder level.
3. Pause for a moment at the top, then inhale as you slowly lower the weights back down to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Pin your elbows to your sides and do not let them drift forward as you curl the weight up.
- Squeeze the biceps hard at the top for a one-second hold before lowering.
- Lower the weight for a 2-3 second count to maximize eccentric tension on the biceps.

## Common mistakes

- Swinging the torso backward to cheat the weight up, which loads the lower back instead of the biceps.
- Moving the elbows forward during the curl, which turns it into a front raise and reduces bicep isolation.
- Using too much weight and performing half reps that never reach full contraction or full extension.
