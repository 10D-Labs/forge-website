## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with your back straight and feet flat on the ground.
2. Hold a barbell with an overhand grip, hands shoulder-width apart, and raise it overhead.
3. Lower the barbell behind your head by bending your elbows, keeping your upper arms close to your head.
4. Pause for a moment, then extend your arms to raise the barbell back to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lower the bar behind your head by bending only at the elbows, keeping your upper arms vertical and close to your ears.
- Fully extend the arms at the top and squeeze the triceps before lowering again.
- Use a moderate grip width (shoulder-width) to keep the wrists in a comfortable position.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the elbows flare wide as you lower the bar, which shifts stress to the shoulders and reduces Tricep Stretch.
- Moving the upper arms forward and back during the rep instead of keeping them locked in place next to your head.
- Arching the lower back to help press the weight up when fatigue sets in.

## FAQ

### Why do overhead Tricep Extensions emphasize the long head?

The long head of the triceps crosses both the elbow and the shoulder joint. When your arms are overhead, the long head is in a stretched position, which makes it work harder through the full range of motion.

### Are overhead extensions safe for the elbows?

They're safe with proper form and moderate weight. The deep stretch can aggravate existing elbow issues, so start light and increase gradually. Stop if you feel sharp pain in the elbow.

### Should I use an EZ bar or straight bar?

An EZ bar is more comfortable for most people because the angled grip reduces wrist strain in the overhead position. A straight bar works but may cause wrist discomfort at heavier loads.

### What muscles does the Barbell Seated Overhead Tricep Extension work?

The Barbell Seated Overhead Tricep Extension primarily targets the triceps, with secondary activation in the shoulders. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.

### Is the Barbell Seated Overhead Tricep Extension good for beginners?

The Barbell Seated Overhead Tricep Extension is rated as intermediate. Beginners should build a base of triceps strength with easier variations first.
