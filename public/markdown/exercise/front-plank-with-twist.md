## How to perform

1. Start in a high plank position with your hands directly under your shoulders and your body in a straight line from head to toe.
2. Engage your core and glutes to maintain a stable position.
3. Rotate your torso to the right, lifting your right arm and extending it towards the ceiling.
4. Keep your hips and legs stable as you twist.
5. Hold for a moment, then return to the starting position.
6. Repeat the twist on the left side.
7. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Stack your wrist directly under your shoulder on the planted arm as you rotate to protect the joint.
- Rotate from the thoracic spine (mid-back) rather than just reaching your arm up to get a true oblique contraction.
- Keep your hips level and resist the urge to let them sag or pike up during the rotation.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the hips drop or sag during the twist, which puts stress on the lower back instead of the obliques.
- Rotating too quickly without control, which uses momentum instead of engaging the core muscles.
- Not extending the arm fully toward the ceiling, which reduces the rotational range and oblique activation.
