## How to perform

1. Lie flat on a bench with your feet flat on the ground and your knees bent.
2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with an overhand grip, palms facing towards your feet.
3. Extend your arms straight up towards the ceiling, keeping a slight bend in your elbows.
4. Slowly lower the dumbbells towards your chest, allowing your elbows to flare out to the sides.
5. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push the dumbbells back up to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use a controlled tempo and lighter weight than your regular bench press since the reverse grip changes the leverage significantly.
- Keep your wrists stacked directly over your elbows throughout the movement to prevent wrist strain.
- Focus on squeezing the upper chest at the top of each rep; the reverse grip naturally emphasizes this area.

## Common mistakes

- Using the same weight as a regular bench press; the reverse grip is mechanically disadvantaged, so start with about 50-60% of your normal weight.
- Letting the dumbbells drift too far toward the face during the press, which puts the shoulders in a vulnerable position.
- Flaring the elbows too wide, losing the unique upper-chest emphasis that the reverse grip provides.
