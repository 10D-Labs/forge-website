3. Grasp the band with a close grip, palms facing towards you.

5. Pull the band down towards your chest, squeezing your shoulder blades together.

- Keep your palms facing you (or each other) in a close-grip position to maximize bicep and lower lat activation.
- Sit tall and pull the band toward your sternum, driving your elbows down and back.
- Control the return phase for 2-3 seconds to maintain tension on the lats throughout each rep.

- Allowing the torso to swing forward and back, using body momentum instead of lat contraction.
- Gripping too wide, which changes the exercise from a close-grip pulldown into a standard pulldown.
- Not fully extending the arms at the top, which shortens the range of motion and reduces the lat stretch.
