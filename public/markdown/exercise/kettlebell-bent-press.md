- Think of this as getting under the weight by bending sideways, not pressing the kettlebell up. Your arm stays nearly locked the whole time.
- Keep your eyes on the kettlebell throughout the entire movement to maintain shoulder stability and tracking.
- The bent press is a skill exercise. Practice with a light weight for many singles before going heavy.

- Trying to press the weight up with arm strength instead of lowering the body underneath the already-extended arm.

- Rushing the movement instead of performing it slowly and deliberately, especially during the lateral bend.
