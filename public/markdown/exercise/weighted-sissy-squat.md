5. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push through your heels to return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

- Hold a weight plate against your chest and use a pole or rack for balance with the free hand.
- Lower slowly until you feel an intense stretch in the quads, then drive up through the balls of your feet.

- Dropping into the bottom position instead of controlling the eccentric for 3-4 seconds.
