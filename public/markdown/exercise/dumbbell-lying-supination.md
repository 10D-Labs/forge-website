## How to perform

1. Lie flat on a bench with your feet flat on the ground.
2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing up and your arms fully extended.
3. Keeping your upper arms stationary, curl the dumbbells towards your shoulders by contracting your forearms.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Focus on the rotating motion from palm-down to palm-up, which is the supination that targets the forearm supinator muscles.
- Keep the dumbbell light (2-5 lbs) and perform slow, deliberate rotations for 15-20 reps per set.
- Anchor your elbow to the bench or your side so only the forearm rotates.

## Common mistakes

- Using too much weight, which causes the upper arm and shoulder to compensate for the small forearm muscles.
- Moving too quickly through the rotation, which relies on momentum rather than controlled muscular effort.
- Confusing this with a standard curl; the focus should be on the rotational component, not the flexion.
