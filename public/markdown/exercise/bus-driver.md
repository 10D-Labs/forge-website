## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand.
2. Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight.
3. Raise your arms out to the sides, keeping a slight bend in your elbows.
4. Continue lifting your arms until they are parallel to the ground.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your arms back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hold a single weight plate at arms length in front of you and rotate it like turning a steering wheel for the intended variation.
- Keep your core braced and avoid swaying your torso as you rotate the plate.
- Use a lighter weight than you think you need since the long lever arm makes this exercise deceptively challenging.

## Common mistakes

- Using too heavy a plate, which causes the arms to drop below shoulder height and reduces shoulder engagement.
- Bending the elbows significantly during the rotation, which shortens the lever arm and makes the exercise easier.
- Rushing through rotations instead of holding each end position briefly to maximize time under tension.
