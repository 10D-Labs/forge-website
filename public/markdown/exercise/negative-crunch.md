## How to perform

1. Lie flat on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground.
2. Place your hands behind your head with your elbows pointing outwards.
3. Engaging your abs, slowly lift your upper body off the ground, curling forward until your torso is at a 45 degree angle.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your upper body back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Focus on the slow lowering phase (3-4 seconds), which is where the ab muscles do the most work.
- Keep your chin slightly tucked and avoid pulling on your neck with your hands.
- Curl your spine segment by segment on the way down rather than dropping as one rigid unit.

## Common mistakes

- Lowering too quickly and using gravity instead of controlling the descent with the abdominals.
- Yanking on the neck with the hands, which strains the cervical spine and reduces ab engagement.
- Stopping at a 45-degree angle instead of going through the full range of motion on both the curl up and the lowering phase.

## FAQ

### What is a Negative Crunch?

A Negative Crunch emphasizes the eccentric (lowering) phase. You crunch up to the top position, then slowly lower back down with maximum control, which creates more time under tension for the abs.

### Are Negative Crunches better than regular crunches?

The eccentric emphasis creates more muscle damage and time under tension, which can lead to greater strength and hypertrophy gains compared to regular speed crunches.

### How slow should the negative phase be?

Aim for 3-5 seconds on the lowering phase. If you can't control the descent for at least 3 seconds, the set is effectively over even if you haven't hit your target reps.

### What muscles does the Negative Crunch work?

The Negative Crunch primarily targets the abs, with secondary activation in the hip flexors. It's classified as a strength exercise for the core.

### Is the Negative Crunch good for beginners?

Yes, the Negative Crunch is rated as a beginner-level exercise. It's a great starting point for building abs strength.
