## How to perform

1. Set up a bench at a height that allows your body to hang freely underneath it.
2. Lie face up on the ground with your head towards the bench.
3. Reach up and grab the bench with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
4. Position your body so that your heels are on the ground and your arms are fully extended.
5. Engage your core and squeeze your shoulder blades together as you pull your chest up towards the bench.
6. Pause for a moment at the top of the movement, then slowly lower your body back down to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Pull your chest directly to the edge of the bench, driving your elbows back and squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top.
- Keep your body rigid from head to heels like a plank throughout each rep.
- To make it harder, elevate your feet on another bench; to make it easier, bend your knees.

## Common mistakes

- Sagging the hips toward the floor, which disengages the core and reduces the pulling demand on the upper back.
- Only pulling halfway up instead of bringing the chest all the way to the bench, limiting the range of motion and muscle activation.
- Craning the neck forward to reach the bench rather than pulling with the back muscles.
