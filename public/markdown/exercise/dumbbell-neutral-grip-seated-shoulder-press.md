## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing inward.
2. Raise the dumbbells to shoulder height, elbows bent and palms facing forward.
3. Press the dumbbells upward until your arms are fully extended overhead.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbells back to shoulder height.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep the palms facing inward (neutral grip) throughout the press, which tends to be easier on the shoulder joints than palms-forward.
- Press straight up from shoulder height to full extension, keeping the dumbbells in line with your ears at the top.
- Sit with your back against the bench for support and your feet planted firmly for a stable pressing base.

## Common mistakes

- Rotating the palms forward during the press, losing the neutral grip benefit.
- Arching the lower back excessively to help press the weight overhead, which stresses the lumbar spine.
- Pressing the dumbbells forward instead of straight up, which shifts the load to the front delts and reduces overall pressing efficiency.
