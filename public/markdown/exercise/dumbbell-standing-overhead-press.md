## Pro tips

- Start with dumbbells at shoulder height, palms facing forward, and press straight overhead to full lockout.
- Brace your core and squeeze your glutes to create a stable base and prevent excessive back arching.
- Lower the dumbbells under control back to shoulder height, touching the dumbbells to the tops of your shoulders before each press.

## Common mistakes

- Arching the lower back to assist the press, which puts the lumbar spine at risk under load.
- Pressing the dumbbells forward instead of straight up, which reduces efficiency and loads the front delts more than necessary.
- Not using full range of motion by stopping short of lockout or not lowering to shoulder level.
