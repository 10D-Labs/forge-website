- Sit on a bench with back support and press the dumbbells from shoulder height straight overhead. Keep your back flat against the bench pad.
- Do not lock out your elbows aggressively at the top. Stop just short of full extension to maintain shoulder tension and protect the joint.
- Lower the dumbbells until your elbows are at a 90-degree angle or slightly below to achieve a full shoulder stretch.

- Arching the back away from the bench pad, which turns this into an incline press and stresses the lower back.
- Pressing the dumbbells forward instead of straight up, which reduces shoulder engagement and increases front delt dominance.
- Letting the dumbbells drift too wide at the bottom, which can strain the shoulder joint.
