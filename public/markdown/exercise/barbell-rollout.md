## How to perform

1. Kneel on the floor and hold a barbell with both hands, shoulder-width apart.
2. Roll the barbell forward, extending your arms and keeping your core engaged.
3. Continue rolling forward until your body is fully extended and your arms are overhead.
4. Pause for a moment, then slowly roll the barbell back towards your knees, maintaining control.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Start from your knees (not standing), brace your core hard, and roll forward only as far as you can while keeping your lower back from sagging.
- Think about pulling the bar back toward your knees using your abs, not your arms or hip flexors.
- Breathe out forcefully as you pull back to the starting position to maximize abdominal contraction.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the lower back arch and hips sag at full extension, which puts dangerous pressure on the lumbar spine.
- Using the hip flexors to pull back instead of the abs, often seen as bending at the hips first during the return.
- Rolling out beyond your current strength level and losing control of the movement.

## FAQ

### Are Barbell Rollouts better than planks for abs?

Barbell Rollouts are significantly more challenging because they work the abs through dynamic anti-extension rather than static. They produce more muscle activation but require a baseline of core strength that planks help build.

### How do I progress to standing Barbell Rollouts?

Master kneeling rollouts to full extension first. Then gradually increase range by starting from a slightly elevated surface. Standing rollouts are an advanced exercise that few people have the core strength for.

### Can Barbell Rollouts replace other ab exercises?

They can be a primary ab exercise since they're so effective, but pairing them with a rotational exercise (like Russian Twists) and a lateral flexion exercise (like side bends) creates more balanced core development.

### What muscles does the Barbell Rollout work?

The Barbell Rollout primarily targets the abs, with secondary activation in the lower back. It's classified as a strength exercise for the core.

### Is the Barbell Rollout good for beginners?

The Barbell Rollout is an advanced exercise. Beginners should master fundamental core movements first.
