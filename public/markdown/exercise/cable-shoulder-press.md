## How to perform

1. Adjust the cable machine so that the handles are at shoulder height.
2. Stand facing away from the machine with your feet shoulder-width apart.
3. Grasp the handles with an overhand grip and bring them up to shoulder level, with your elbows bent and pointing outwards.
4. Press the handles upwards until your arms are fully extended overhead.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the handles back down to shoulder level.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Face away from the machine and press from shoulder height upward. The cable pulling from behind adds constant tension that dumbbells lack at the top of the press.
- Keep your core braced and avoid arching your lower back as you press overhead. If you arch, the weight is too heavy.
- Press in a slight arc, not straight up, ending with the handles directly above your shoulders at full arm extension.

## Common mistakes

- Arching the lower back excessively to press the weight, which shifts the load to the upper chest and stresses the lumbar spine.
- Standing too close to the machine, which creates an awkward cable angle and limits the range of motion.
- Pressing the handles forward instead of upward, which turns this into a chest exercise rather than a shoulder press.

## FAQ

### Is the Cable Shoulder Press better than dumbbell shoulder press?

The cable version provides constant tension throughout the full range of motion, including at the top where dumbbells lose resistance. This makes it excellent for shoulder hypertrophy, though dumbbells allow heavier loads.

### Can I do Cable Shoulder Press seated?

Yes, placing a bench inside the cable machine and sitting upright eliminates lower body momentum and increases shoulder isolation. Use a bench with back support for heavier loads.

### What muscles does the Cable Shoulder Press work?

The Cable Shoulder Press primarily targets the shoulders, with secondary activation in the triceps, upper back. It's classified as a strength exercise for the shoulders.

### Is the Cable Shoulder Press good for beginners?

The Cable Shoulder Press is rated as intermediate. Beginners should build a base of shoulders strength with easier variations first.
