## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing inwards.
2. Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight and chest up.
3. Raise your arms out to the sides, keeping a slight bend in your elbows, until they are parallel to the floor.
4. Rotate your arms so that your palms are facing downwards.
5. Slowly lower your arms back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Start the fly with palms facing inward, then rotate your arms as you raise them so palms face the floor at the top position.
- The rotation adds an external rotation component that targets the rotator cuff alongside the rear delts.
- Perform the rotation smoothly throughout the raise rather than snapping the wrists at the top.

## Common mistakes

- Only rotating at the wrist instead of from the entire forearm and shoulder, which misses the rotator cuff benefit.
- Using too heavy a weight that prevents the smooth rotation component, turning this into a standard reverse fly.
- Rushing through the rotation portion of the movement instead of integrating it with the raise.
