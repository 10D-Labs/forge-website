## How to perform

1. Find a suspension trainer and adjust it to an appropriate height.
2. Stand facing away from the anchor point and hold the handles with an overhand grip.
3. Walk your feet forward, leaning your body forward until your weight is supported by the suspension trainer.
4. Keep your body straight from head to heels, engage your core, and lower your chest towards the handles.
5. Push through your chest and arms to return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep the straps close to your body and your hands directly under your shoulders for the most stable pressing position.
- Engage your core hard to prevent the straps from swaying during the press.
- Lower your chest between the handles for a deeper stretch than a regular Pushup provides.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the straps swing outward during the descent, which puts the shoulder in a compromised position.
- Not going deep enough to take advantage of the extra range of motion the suspension trainer allows.
- Placing the feet too close to the anchor point, which makes the exercise too easy.

## FAQ

### Are Suspended Pushups harder than regular Pushups?

Yes. The instability of the suspension trainer forces your chest, shoulders, and core to work much harder to stabilize the movement. Most people can do significantly fewer Suspended Pushups than regular ones.

### Where should I place my feet relative to the anchor point?

The further your feet are from the anchor point, the more horizontal your body becomes and the harder the exercise. Start with your feet about 4-5 feet from the anchor and adjust to your strength level.

### Can Suspended Pushups replace regular bench press?

They're a supplement, not a replacement. Suspended Pushups build stability and muscle activation that bench pressing doesn't, but you can't load them as heavily for pure strength development.

### What muscles does the Suspended Pushup work?

The Suspended Pushup primarily targets the chest, with secondary activation in the triceps, shoulders, core. It's classified as a strength exercise for the chest.

### Is the Suspended Pushup good for beginners?

The Suspended Pushup is an advanced exercise. Beginners should master fundamental chest movements first.
