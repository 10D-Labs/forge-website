## How to perform

1. Lie flat on a bench with your head at one end and your feet on the floor.
2. Hold a barbell with a shoulder-width grip and extend your arms straight above your chest.
3. Keeping your arms straight, lower the barbell behind your head in a controlled manner until you feel a stretch in your lats.
4. Pause for a moment, then raise the barbell back to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep a slight bend in your elbows throughout and think about driving the bar back up with your lats, not your arms.
- Lower the bar behind your head only until you feel a deep stretch in the lats and chest; don't force the range of motion beyond what your shoulders allow.
- Keep your hips down and your ribcage expanded throughout the movement to maximize the lat stretch.

## Common mistakes

- Bending the elbows too much during the lowering phase, which turns it into a skull crusher variation.
- Lifting the hips off the bench as the bar goes behind the head, which reduces the stretch on the lats.
- Using too much weight and compensating with a shortened range of motion.

## FAQ

### Do Pullovers work the chest or the back?

Both. The stretch phase at the bottom targets the lats and serratus, while the pulling phase back to the start involves the chest. Focus on squeezing the lats during the pull to emphasize back, or squeezing the chest to target pecs.

### Should I lie fully on the bench or across it?

Lying across the bench (only upper back on the bench) allows your hips to drop, increasing the stretch. Lying fully on the bench is safer and better for beginners.

### Are barbell or Dumbbell Pullovers better?

Dumbbells allow a more natural hand position and slightly greater range of motion. Barbells let you load heavier. Both are effective; try both and use whichever feels more comfortable.

The Barbell Pullover primarily targets the lats, with secondary activation in the chest, triceps. It's classified as a strength exercise for the back.
