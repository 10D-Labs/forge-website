## How to perform

1. Stand up straight with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing your torso.
2. Keep your elbows close to your torso and rotate the palms of your hands until they are facing forward.
3. This will be your starting position.
4. Now, keeping the upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps.
5. Continue to raise the weights until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level.
6. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
7. Then, inhale and slowly begin to lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
8. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep the neutral (hammer) grip throughout with palms facing each other to target the brachialis and brachioradialis alongside the biceps.
- Press your upper arms firmly into the preacher pad and resist the urge to lift them during the curl.
- Lower the dumbbells slowly through the full range until your arms are nearly straight to maximize the stretch on the brachialis.

## Common mistakes

- Lifting the elbows off the preacher pad at the top of the curl, which allows momentum and reduces isolation.
- Rotating the wrists to a supinated (palms-up) position, which turns this into a standard Preacher Curl and reduces brachialis involvement.
- Cutting the range of motion short by not lowering fully, which misses the most effective stretched portion of the exercise.

Yes. The brachialis sits underneath the biceps and when developed pushes the biceps up, creating wider-looking arms from the front.

Yes, and single arm versions allow better concentration and help identify left-right strength differences.
