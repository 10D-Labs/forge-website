## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent.
2. Grasp a pullup bar with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3. Hang from the bar with your arms fully extended and your palms facing away from you.
4. Engage your core and pull your body up towards the bar, bringing your chin above the bar.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your body back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use a supinated (underhand) grip and initiate the pull by driving your elbows down and back to activate the lats and biceps simultaneously.
- At the top of the Chinup, tuck your knees toward your chest to add a core crunch component that targets the abs.
- Control the descent over 3 seconds to build strength through the full range of motion.

## Common mistakes

- Using a kipping motion to get the chin over the bar, which removes the core and bicep challenge.
- Neglecting the knee tuck at the top, which is what differentiates this from a standard Chinup.
- Letting the body swing freely, which reduces core engagement and increases shoulder strain.
