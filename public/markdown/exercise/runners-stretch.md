## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet hip-width apart.
2. Take a step forward with your right foot, keeping your left foot planted.
3. Bend your right knee and lower your body down, keeping your left leg straight.
4. Place your hands on your right thigh for support.
5. Hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds, then switch sides and repeat.

## Pro tips

- Keep your back leg straight and press the heel toward the ground to add a calf stretch to the Hamstring Stretch on the front leg.
- Hinge forward from the hips with a flat back rather than rounding your spine to reach further.
- Place your hands on your front thigh for support, not on the knee itself, to avoid pressing the kneecap downward.

## Common mistakes

- Rounding the back to try to get lower, which stretches the lumbar spine instead of the hamstrings.
- Bending the front knee deeply, which reduces the Hamstring Stretch; keep the front knee soft but not deeply bent.
- Pressing hands directly onto the kneecap for support, which can irritate the joint.
