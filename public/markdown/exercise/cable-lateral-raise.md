# Cable Lateral Raise

## Quick answer

The cable lateral raise is an isolation exercise that targets the deltoid muscles, particularly the lateral (middle) head. It is performed using a cable machine, which provides constant tension throughout the movement. This exercise helps build shoulder width and strength. Intermediate shoulders exercise using cable. Targets shoulders, also works traps, triceps.

## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and grasp the cable handles with an overhand grip.
2. Keep your arms straight and your core engaged.
3. Raise your arms out to the sides until they are parallel to the floor.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your arms back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Position the cable at the lowest setting and stand sideways to the machine so the cable crosses behind or in front of your body for the best resistance curve.
- Lead the movement with your elbow, not your hand. Think about pushing your elbow up toward the ceiling.
- Stop at shoulder height. Going higher recruits the upper traps and reduces lateral delt isolation.

## Common mistakes

- Shrugging the shoulder up as you raise the arm, which activates the upper traps instead of the lateral delts.
- Using too much weight and swinging the cable up with body momentum rather than a controlled Lateral Raise.
- Raising the arm in front of the body instead of directly to the side, which shifts emphasis to the anterior delt.

## FAQ

### Should I do Cable Lateral Raises standing or seated?

Standing allows for slightly more weight and a natural body position. Seated removes the ability to use momentum, making it stricter and better for isolation.

### Cable Lateral Raise vs Dumbbell Lateral Raise: which is better?

Cable Lateral Raises provide constant tension throughout the range of motion, including at the bottom where dumbbells provide zero resistance. Cables are generally superior for lateral delt hypertrophy.

### What muscles does the Cable Lateral Raise work?

The Cable Lateral Raise primarily targets the shoulders, with secondary activation in the traps, triceps. It's classified as a strength exercise for the shoulders.

### Is the Cable Lateral Raise good for beginners?

The Cable Lateral Raise is rated as intermediate. Beginners should build a base of shoulders strength with easier variations first.
