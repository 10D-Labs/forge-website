## How to perform

1. Attach a cable handle to a low pulley and sit facing the machine with your feet flat on the floor.
2. Grasp the handle with your right hand and extend your arm fully, keeping a slight bend in your elbow.
3. Lean forward from your hips, keeping your back straight and your abs engaged.
4. Pull the handle towards your torso by retracting your shoulder blade and bending your elbow, keeping your arm close to your body.
5. Squeeze your back muscles at the top of the movement, then slowly return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch sides and perform with your left arm.

## Pro tips

- Rotate your torso slightly as you pull each side to mimic the kayaking motion and engage the obliques.
- Keep the pulling elbow tight to the body and drive it behind you, squeezing the lat at peak contraction.
- Maintain a slight forward lean from the hips with a braced core throughout the set.

## Common mistakes

- Sitting too upright and pulling only with the arm, missing the rotational core component that makes this exercise unique.
- Rounding the back as you reach forward, which puts the spine in a vulnerable position under load.
- Using too heavy a weight, which prevents the controlled rotation and turns it into a sloppy rowing motion.

## FAQ

### What is a Cable Kayak Row?

It is a single-arm cable row performed with an alternating, rotational motion that mimics a kayak paddle stroke. It trains the lats, rhomboids, and obliques simultaneously.

### Is the kayak row better than a regular cable row?

It is not better or worse; it serves a different purpose. The kayak row adds a rotational anti-rotation component that challenges the core in ways a standard cable row does not.

### Can I do kayak rows with a resistance band?

Yes, anchor a band at a low point and perform the same alternating rowing motion. Bands work well as a substitute when a cable machine is not available.

### What muscles does the Cable Kayak Row work?

The Cable Kayak Row primarily targets the lats, with secondary activation in the biceps, rhomboids, rear deltoids. It's classified as a strength exercise for the back.

### Is the Cable Kayak Row good for beginners?
