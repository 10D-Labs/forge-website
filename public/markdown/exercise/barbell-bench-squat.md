## How to perform

1. Set up a barbell on a squat rack at chest height.
2. Stand facing away from the rack, with your feet shoulder-width apart.
3. Bend your knees and lower your body down into a squat position, keeping your back straight and chest up.

5. Lift the barbell off the rack and step back, ensuring your feet are still shoulder-width apart.

7. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push through your heels to return to the starting position.

## Pro tips

- Set the bench height so that when you sit on it, your thighs are parallel to the ground, ensuring consistent depth every rep.
- Lightly tap the bench with your glutes but don't fully sit down and relax, keeping your muscles engaged throughout.
- Drive up through your heels and mid-foot, not your toes, to maximize quad and glute activation.

## Common mistakes

- Sitting down hard on the bench and losing all tension, which forces you to restart each rep from a dead stop and can compress the spine.
- Placing the bench too far forward or back, causing you to reach for it or not hit proper depth.
- Rounding the lower back at the bottom because you're focused on reaching the bench rather than maintaining posture.
