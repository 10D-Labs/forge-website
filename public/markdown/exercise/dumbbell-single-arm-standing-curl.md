## How to perform

2. Keeping your upper arm stationary, exhale and curl the weight upward while contracting your biceps.
3. Continue to raise the dumbbell until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbell is at shoulder level.
4. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
5. Inhale and slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch arms.

## Pro tips

- Stand tall with your non-working hand on your hip or holding a stable surface to prevent body rotation.
- Keep your working elbow pinned to your side and curl the dumbbell in a smooth arc to shoulder height.
- Supinate fully at the top (turn your pinky outward) to maximize bicep contraction.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning to the side to counterbalance the dumbbell instead of keeping your torso upright.
- Swinging the dumbbell up with hip momentum rather than curling with pure bicep force.
- Not fully extending the arm at the bottom, which shortens the range of motion.

## FAQ

### Is single-arm curling better than both arms at once?

Single-arm curls let you focus on one bicep at a time and use slightly more weight per arm since your core doesn't have to stabilize bilaterally. They're excellent for fixing imbalances.

### Should I do all reps on one arm then switch?

Yes, completing all reps on one arm before switching ensures each bicep gets the same focused attention without alternating fatigue.

### How do I prevent cheating on the last reps?

Place your free hand on your working bicep to monitor for swinging. If your body starts rocking, the set is effectively over or the weight is too heavy.
