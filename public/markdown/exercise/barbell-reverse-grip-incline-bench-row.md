6. Pause for a moment at the top of the movement.

## Pro tips

- Keep your chest pressed firmly into the bench throughout the row to eliminate lower back involvement.
- Pull with your elbows driving back past your torso, focusing on squeezing the shoulder blades together at the top.
- Use an underhand (supinated) grip shoulder-width apart to increase biceps recruitment and allow a longer range of motion.

## Common mistakes

- Lifting the chest off the bench to cheat the weight up, which defeats the purpose of the incline support.
- Using a grip that is too wide, which limits range of motion and shifts the emphasis away from the lats.
- Extending the wrists backward under load, which strains the forearm flexors.
