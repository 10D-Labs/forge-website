5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Let the bar roll down to your fingertips at the bottom of each rep, then curl it back up by flexing your wrists for maximum range of motion.

- Using too much weight and jerking the wrists, which can strain the tendons.
- Not rolling the bar to the fingertips at the bottom, shortening the range of motion.
