## How to perform

1. Attach a straight bar to a low pulley cable machine.
2. Stand facing the machine with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent.
3. Grasp the bar with an underhand grip, hands shoulder-width apart.
4. Keep your elbows close to your sides and your upper arms stationary throughout the exercise.
5. Exhale and curl the bar up towards your shoulders, contracting your biceps.
6. Pause for a moment at the top of the movement, squeezing your biceps.
7. Inhale and slowly lower the bar back to the starting position, fully extending your arms.
8. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Stand about 12 inches from the cable stack to keep constant tension on the biceps throughout the entire range of motion.
- Use a shoulder-width or slightly narrower grip on the straight bar for the close-grip variation.
- Lean forward slightly at the start to prevent the weight stack from bottoming out at the bottom of the rep.

## Common mistakes

- Standing too close to the machine, which causes the cable to lose tension at the bottom of each rep.
- Using the shoulders to lift the bar by letting the elbows swing forward.
- Leaning back excessively at the top of the curl, using body English instead of bicep contraction.
