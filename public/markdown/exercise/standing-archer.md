2. Extend your arms straight out in front of you at shoulder height, parallel to the ground.
3. Rotate your torso to the right, keeping your arms extended and your back straight.

5. Hold the position for a moment, then return to the starting position.
6. Repeat the motion, this time rotating your torso to the left and extending your left arm forward and your right arm back.
7. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Focus on rotating through your thoracic spine (upper back) while keeping your hips square and facing forward.
- Pull the trailing arm back as if drawing a bow to fully engage the rear deltoid and rhomboids.
- Move slowly and deliberately, holding the end position for 1-2 seconds before returning to center.

## Common mistakes

- Rotating from the hips and lower back instead of isolating the rotation to the thoracic spine.
- Not pulling the trailing arm back far enough, missing the scapular retraction benefit.
- Straightening the knees and standing rigidly instead of maintaining a slight knee bend for stability.
