4. Return to the starting position and repeat the movement with your left hand reaching towards your toes and your right leg lifting up behind you.
5. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

- Reach across to the opposite foot with one hand while keeping your arms wide and extended to increase the rotational stretch.
- Lift the back leg straight and in line with your torso as you reach down, creating a T-shape with your body.
- Move slowly and focus on balance; this is as much a stability exercise as it is a stretch.

- Bending the standing knee too much, which reduces the Hamstring Stretch and balance challenge.
- Rounding the back to reach the toes instead of hinging at the hips with a flat back.
- Rushing through the movement without achieving a stable, balanced position at the bottom.
