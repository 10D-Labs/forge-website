3. Slowly curl your fingers towards your palms, squeezing the barbell tightly.
4. Hold the contraction for a moment, then slowly release your fingers back to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Let the bar roll down to your fingertips at the bottom before curling it back into your palm for a full range of motion.
- Keep your forearms pressed firmly against your thighs throughout the movement to isolate the finger flexors.
- Use a slow, deliberate tempo. This exercise is about grip endurance and forearm development, not heavy loading.

- Going too heavy and using a jerky motion, which can strain the finger tendons and reduces the training effect.
- Not allowing the bar to roll far enough down to the fingertips, cutting the range of motion short.
