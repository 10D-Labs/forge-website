2. Allow your wrists to hang over the edge of the bench.
3. Slowly curl your wrists upward, squeezing your forearms at the top of the movement.
4. Pause for a moment, then slowly lower your wrists back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Let the dumbbells roll all the way down to your fingertips at the bottom for maximum forearm flexor stretch.
- Curl through the full range of motion, squeezing your forearms hard at the top when your wrists are fully flexed.
- Keep your forearms pressed flat on the bench and only move from the wrists to ensure pure forearm isolation.

## Common mistakes

- Using partial range of motion by not letting the wrists fully extend at the bottom of each rep.
- Going too heavy and compensating by lifting the forearms off the bench, which introduces bicep activity.
- Performing fast, bouncing reps that rely on momentum instead of controlled forearm contractions.
