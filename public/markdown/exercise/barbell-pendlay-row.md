## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent.
2. Bend forward at the hips, keeping your back straight and your chest up.
3. Grasp the barbell with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
4. Pull the barbell towards your upper abdomen, squeezing your shoulder blades together.
5. Lower the barbell back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Reset the bar on the floor between every rep; each pull starts from a dead stop, which is what defines a Pendlay row.
- Keep your back parallel to the floor and pull the bar explosively to your upper abdomen.
- Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top, then lower the bar under control back to the floor.

## Common mistakes

- Not returning the bar to the floor between reps, which turns it into a standard Bent Over Row and removes the dead-stop benefit.
- Raising the torso during the pull, which uses momentum and reduces upper back activation.
- Using too wide a grip, which limits range of motion and reduces lat involvement.

## FAQ

### What is the difference between a Pendlay row and a Bent Over Row?

Most lifters use 60-80% of their conventional Deadlift weight. The dead stop and strict parallel torso position naturally limit the weight compared to a standard Bent Over Row.

The Barbell Pendlay Row primarily targets the upper back, with secondary activation in the biceps, forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the back.
