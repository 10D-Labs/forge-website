2. Wrap the resistance band around your thighs, just above your knees.
3. Place your hands on the sides of the chair or bench for support.
4. Engage your abductors (outer thigh muscles) and slowly push your knees apart, against the resistance of the band.
5. Pause for a moment at the end of the movement, then slowly bring your knees back together.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Sit tall with your back straight and push your knees apart against the band, not forward.
- Hold the open position for 1-2 seconds to maximize outer glute and abductor activation.
- Control the return and do not let the band snap your knees back together.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning back or forward during the movement, which changes the hip angle and reduces abductor isolation.
- Using a band that is too light, providing insufficient resistance for a training effect.
- Rushing through reps and letting the band control the eccentric (return) phase.
