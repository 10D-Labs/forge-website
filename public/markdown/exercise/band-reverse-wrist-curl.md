6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Rest your forearms on your thighs with wrists hanging off the edge and palms facing down for proper positioning.
- Curl the wrists upward slowly against the band resistance, focusing on the top of the forearm contraction.
- Use a light band because the wrist extensors are small muscles that fatigue quickly.

- Lifting the forearms off the thighs during the curl, which recruits the biceps and defeats the isolation purpose.
- Using a band that is too thick, causing compensatory movements and wrist strain.
- Performing the movement too quickly without controlling the eccentric phase.
