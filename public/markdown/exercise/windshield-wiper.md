## How to perform

1. Hang from a pullup bar with your arms fully extended and your legs straight.
2. Engage your core and lift your legs up towards your chest, keeping them straight.
3. Once your legs are parallel to the ground, twist your hips to one side, bringing your legs towards that side.
4. Pause for a moment, then return to the starting position.
5. Repeat the movement, but this time twist your hips to the opposite side.
6. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your legs as straight as possible and rotate from the hips, using your obliques to control the side-to-side motion.
- Start with a smaller range of motion (45 degrees each side) and increase as your core strength improves.
- Grip the bar hard and actively pull your shoulder blades down to stay stable as your legs rotate.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the legs drop too quickly to one side, relying on gravity rather than controlled oblique engagement.
- Bending the knees excessively, which makes the exercise easier but reduces the training stimulus.
- Not maintaining tension at the transition point when the legs pass through center.
