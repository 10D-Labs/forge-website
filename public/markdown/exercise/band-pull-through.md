## How to perform

1. Attach a resistance band to a sturdy anchor point at ground level.
2. Stand facing away from the anchor point with your feet shoulder-width apart.
3. Step forward to create tension in the band, keeping your knees slightly bent.
4. Hinge at the hips and push your glutes back, maintaining a slight bend in your knees.
5. Lower your torso until it is parallel to the ground, feeling a stretch in your hamstrings.
6. Drive your hips forward and squeeze your glutes to return to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Drive your hips back until you feel a deep stretch in the hamstrings, then snap the hips forward by squeezing the glutes.
- Keep your arms straight and let the band pass between your legs; your arms are just hooks, not the movers.
- Stand far enough from the anchor to maintain band tension even at the top of the movement.

## Common mistakes

- Squatting down instead of hinging at the hips, which turns it into a squat rather than a hip hinge.
- Pulling the band with the arms instead of driving the hips forward to create the movement.
- Not squeezing the glutes at the top, ending the rep in a soft lockout that misses the peak contraction.
