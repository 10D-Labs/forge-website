## How to Perform Barbell Clean and Press

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and the barbell on the floor in front of you.
2. Bend your knees and hinge at the hips to lower down and grip the barbell with an overhand grip, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3. Drive through your heels and extend your hips and knees to lift the barbell off the floor, keeping it close to your body.
4. As the barbell reaches your thighs, explosively extend your hips, shrug your shoulders, and pull the barbell up towards your chest.
5. As the barbell reaches chest height, quickly drop under it and catch it at shoulder level, with your elbows pointing forward and your palms facing up.
6. From the catch position, press the barbell overhead by extending your arms and pushing the barbell straight up.
7. Lower the barbell back down to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
