## How to perform

1. Set up a decline bench at a 45 degree angle.
2. Lie face down on the bench with your chest and stomach resting against it.
3. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your arms fully extended towards the floor.
4. Keeping your arms straight, raise your shoulders towards your ears as high as possible.
5. Hold the contraction for a moment, then slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lie face down on a decline bench (inclined at about 45 degrees) with dumbbells hanging straight down. Shrug your shoulders up toward your ears, squeezing the mid-traps and rhomboids.
- This face-down angle targets the middle and lower trapezius fibers that standard standing shrugs miss entirely.
- Hold the contraction at the top for 2-3 seconds and focus on pulling your shoulder blades together and up.

## Common mistakes

- Using too much weight and barely moving the shoulders. The decline angle makes the movement harder, so use less weight than standing shrugs.
- Bending the elbows during the shrug, which turns this into a partial row.
- Not squeezing at the top, which wastes the unique advantage of the decline angle for mid-trap activation.
