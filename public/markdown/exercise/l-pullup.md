## How to perform

1. Grab the pullup bar with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
2. Hang with your arms fully extended and your body straight.
3. Engage your lats and biceps to pull your body up towards the bar, keeping your elbows close to your body.
4. Continue pulling until your chin is above the bar.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your body back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hold your legs at a 90-degree angle to your torso throughout the entire pull, not just at the top.
- Point your toes and squeeze your quads to keep your legs locked in the L-position.
- Initiate the pull by depressing your shoulder blades before bending your arms.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the legs drop below 90 degrees during the pulling phase, which reduces core engagement.
- Swinging or kipping to initiate the pull instead of performing a strict Pullup from a dead hang.
- Bending the knees slightly to make the hold easier, which changes the lever arm and reduces difficulty.

## FAQ

### What do L-Pullups work that regular Pullups don't?

The L-hold adds significant core, hip flexor, and quad isometric work. Your abs must contract hard throughout to maintain the leg position, making it a Pullup and core exercise in one.

Practice L-hangs (hanging with legs at 90 degrees) for timed holds first. Build up to 20-30 seconds before adding the Pullup component.

### Are L-Pullups harder than regular Pullups?

Yes, significantly. The L-position shifts your center of gravity forward and requires your core to work the entire time, increasing the total demand substantially.

The L-pullup primarily targets the lats, with secondary activation in the biceps, forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the back.

### Is the L-pullup good for beginners?

The L-pullup is an advanced exercise. Beginners should master fundamental back movements first.
