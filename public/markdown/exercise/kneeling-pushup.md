## How to Perform Kneeling Pushup

1. Start by kneeling on the ground with your hands shoulder-width apart, fingers pointing forward.
2. Extend your legs behind you, resting on the balls of your feet, so that your body forms a straight line from head to heels.
3. Engage your core and lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows, keeping them close to your sides.
4. Continue lowering until your chest is just above the ground, then push back up to the starting position by straightening your arms.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
