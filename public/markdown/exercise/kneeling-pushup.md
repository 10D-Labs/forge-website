## How to perform

1. Start by kneeling on the ground with your hands shoulder-width apart, fingers pointing forward.
2. Extend your legs behind you, resting on the balls of your feet, so that your body forms a straight line from head to heels.
3. Engage your core and lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows, keeping them close to your sides.
4. Continue lowering until your chest is just above the ground, then push back up to the starting position by straightening your arms.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Maintain a straight line from your knees to your head; do not let your hips sag or pike.
- Lower your chest between your hands and keep your elbows at about 45 degrees from your body.
- Fully extend your arms at the top of each rep to complete the range of motion.

## Common mistakes

- Placing the knees too far back, which makes the exercise too easy and reduces chest and tricep activation.
- Letting the hips sag, which strains the lower back instead of engaging the core.
- Only performing half reps by not lowering the chest close to the floor.
