2. Extend your arms overhead and interlace your fingers.
3. Keeping your back straight, slowly lean to the right side, feeling a stretch in your left lat muscle.
4. Hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds, then return to the starting position.
5. Repeat the stretch on the left side, leaning to the left and feeling a stretch in your right lat muscle.
6. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Sit your hips back toward your heels as you lean to each side to deepen the lat stretch.
- Breathe deeply into the side being stretched, expanding the ribcage to increase the stretch intensity.
- Hold each side for at least 20 seconds and do not bounce or pulse, just steady pressure.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning forward instead of directly to the side, which stretches the lower back rather than the lats.
- Holding breath during the stretch, which increases muscle tension and reduces effectiveness.
- Rushing through the stretch without holding long enough for the muscle to actually release.
