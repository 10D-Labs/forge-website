## How to perform

1. Sit on the edge of a bench or chair with your hands gripping the edge, fingers pointing forward.
2. Slide your butt off the bench, supporting your weight with your hands.
3. Lower your body by bending your elbows until your upper arms are parallel to the floor.
4. Push yourself back up to the starting position by straightening your arms.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your hands close to your hips on the bench edge with fingers pointing forward to maximize triceps engagement.
- Lower until your upper arms are parallel to the floor, then press back up powerfully through your palms.
- Keep your back close to the bench throughout the movement to keep the load on the triceps rather than the shoulders.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the elbows flare outward instead of keeping them pointing straight back, which shifts stress to the shoulders.
- Sliding the hips too far forward from the bench, which increases shoulder strain and reduces triceps focus.
- Shrugging the shoulders up toward the ears during the dip instead of keeping them depressed.
