## How to perform

1. Lie on a decline bench with your feet secured and your head lower than your hips.
2. Grasp the barbell with a wide grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3. Lower the barbell to your chest, keeping your elbows out to the sides.
4. Push the barbell back up to the starting position, fully extending your arms.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Grip the bar at 1.5-2 times shoulder width to maximize the stretch across the chest fibers at the bottom position.
- Lower the bar to the lower portion of your chest, just below the nipple line, for optimal lower-chest engagement.
- Control the descent for at least 2 seconds; the wide grip makes the shoulder joint more vulnerable to fast, uncontrolled movements.

## Common mistakes

- Gripping so wide that the wrists bend backward, which limits pressing power and risks wrist injury.
- Lowering the bar to the upper chest or neck, which places the shoulder in a vulnerable position with a wide grip.
- Failing to secure feet under the pads before pressing, leading to instability on the decline.
