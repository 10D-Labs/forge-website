## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Bend your knees and lower your body into a squat position.
3. Swing your arms back for momentum.
4. Jump forward explosively, extending your hips, knees, and ankles.
5. Land softly on the balls of your feet and immediately go into the next jump.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Swing your arms aggressively from behind your hips to overhead during takeoff to generate maximum forward momentum.
- Land softly by absorbing the impact through your ankles, knees, and hips rather than landing stiff-legged.
- Focus on jumping both forward and slightly up; a flat trajectory means your hips aren't extending fully.

## Common mistakes

- Landing with locked knees, which sends shock through the joints and increases injury risk.
- Not using the arms for counterbalance, which reduces jump distance and landing stability.
- Leaning too far forward on the takeoff, which limits hip extension power and causes you to stumble on landing.
