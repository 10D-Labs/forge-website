1. Adjust the seat height and grip the handles of the machine.
2. Keep your back straight and your feet flat on the ground.
3. Exhale and squeeze the handles, contracting your forearms.
4. Hold the contraction for a second, then slowly release and return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

- Squeeze the handles in a slow, controlled manner rather than slamming them shut for maximum forearm activation.
- Hold the fully squeezed position for 1-2 seconds on each rep to increase time under tension.
- Keep your wrist in a neutral position throughout to avoid wrist strain and ensure the forearms do the work.

- Using fast, jerky reps that rely on momentum rather than muscular contraction, reducing the strength-building benefit.
- Gripping only with the fingers rather than engaging the entire hand and forearm musculature.
- Neglecting the eccentric (opening) phase by letting the handles spring back open instead of controlling the release.
