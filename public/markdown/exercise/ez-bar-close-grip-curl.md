## How to perform

1. Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold the ez barbell with an underhand grip, hands shoulder-width apart.
2. Keep your elbows close to your torso and your upper arms stationary throughout the movement.
3. Curl the barbell up towards your shoulders, contracting your biceps.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the barbell back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Grip the inner narrow angles of the EZ bar to shift emphasis toward the long head (outer biceps) and brachialis.
- Pin your elbows to your sides and only allow your forearms to move; any elbow drift forward means your front delts are helping.
- Squeeze hard at the top for one full second before lowering to maximize the peak contraction.

## Common mistakes

- Swinging the torso backward to generate momentum, which takes work away from the biceps.
- Letting the bar drop quickly on the eccentric rather than controlling the descent for 2-3 seconds.
- Gripping too tightly, which fatigues the forearms before the biceps are fully worked.
