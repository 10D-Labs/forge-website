## How to perform

1. Attach a straight bar to a low pulley cable machine.
2. Lie face up on a flat bench with your feet flat on the ground.
3. Grasp the bar with an underhand grip, hands shoulder-width apart.
4. Extend your arms fully, keeping your elbows close to your sides.
5. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the bar up towards your shoulders.
6. Pause for a moment at the top, squeezing your biceps.
7. Inhale and slowly lower the bar back to the starting position, fully extending your arms.
8. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Position the bench about 2 feet from the low pulley so the cable pulls at an angle that keeps tension through the full range.
- Pin your upper arms to your sides and keep your elbows pointed at the ceiling throughout the curl.
- Squeeze the biceps hard at the top, then take 3 seconds to lower the bar back down.

## Common mistakes

- Positioning too far from or too close to the pulley, which changes the angle of tension and may reduce bicep loading.
- Lifting the elbows off the bench during the curl, which recruits the shoulders.
- Arching the back off the bench to generate momentum on heavy reps.
