## How to perform

1. Start by hanging from a pullup bar with your palms facing away from you and your arms fully extended.
2. Retract your shoulder blades by pulling them down and back.
3. Engage your back muscles and pull your body up towards the bar, focusing on squeezing your shoulder blades together.
4. Pause for a moment at the top of the movement, then slowly lower your body back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your arms completely straight throughout the movement; the only motion should come from your shoulder blades.
- Think about pulling your shoulder blades 'into your back pockets' to initiate the movement.
- Hold the retracted (top) position for 2-3 seconds to build endurance in the scapular stabilizers.

## Common mistakes

- Bending the elbows and turning it into a partial Pullup instead of isolating the scapular movement.
- Using momentum to bounce at the bottom instead of controlled scapular depression and retraction.
- Not achieving enough range of motion; the body should visibly rise 1-2 inches from the scapular movement alone.
