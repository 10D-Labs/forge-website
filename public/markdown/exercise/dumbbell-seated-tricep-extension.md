## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with your back straight and feet flat on the ground.
2. Hold a dumbbell with both hands and extend your arms straight up overhead.
3. Bend your elbows and lower the dumbbell behind your head, keeping your upper arms close to your ears.
4. Pause for a moment, then straighten your arms and return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your upper arms locked in place next to your ears; only your forearms should move during the extension.
- Lower the dumbbell slowly behind your head for a full stretch on the long head of the triceps before pressing back up.
- Brace your core and avoid arching your lower back, especially as the weight gets heavier.

## Common mistakes

- Flaring the elbows outward as you lower the weight, which reduces Tricep Stretch and increases elbow strain.
- Using momentum to swing the dumbbell up rather than pressing with controlled tricep contraction.
- Arching the lower back excessively, especially when fatigued, which can cause lumbar strain.
