## How to perform

1. Attach the band to a high anchor point, such as a pullup bar or sturdy beam.
2. Stand facing the anchor point with your feet shoulder-width apart.
3. Grasp the band with an underhand grip, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
4. Extend your arms fully overhead, keeping your elbows slightly bent.
5. Engage your lats and pull the band down towards your chest, squeezing your shoulder blades together.
6. Pause for a moment at the bottom of the movement, then slowly release the tension and return to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use a supinated (underhand) grip to increase bicep involvement alongside the lat activation.
- Pull the band down to your upper chest while arching slightly and squeezing the lats.
- Focus on driving the elbows down and back rather than just bending the arms.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling primarily with the biceps by not initiating the movement with shoulder blade depression.
- Leaning back excessively, which turns it into a row movement instead of a pulldown.
- Not fully extending the arms overhead between reps, which shortens the range of motion.
