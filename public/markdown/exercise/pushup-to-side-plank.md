2. Lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows, keeping your core engaged.
3. Push back up to the starting position.
4. Shift your weight onto your left hand and rotate your body to the right, lifting your right arm towards the ceiling.
5. Hold the side plank position for a few seconds, then return to the starting position.
6. Repeat the pushup and side plank on the opposite side.

## Pro tips

- Rotate your entire body as one unit when transitioning to the side plank; don't just lift your arm.
- Stack your feet or stagger them for the side plank and fully extend the top arm toward the ceiling.
- Maintain a tight core throughout the transition; the moment between Pushup and plank is where form breaks down.

## Common mistakes

- Rushing the side plank rotation and not holding it long enough to get the anti-rotation core benefit.
- Letting the hips drop during the side plank phase instead of keeping the body in a straight line.
- Placing the support hand too far forward during the side plank, which makes the position unstable.
