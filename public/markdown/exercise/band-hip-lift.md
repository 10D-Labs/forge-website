## How to perform

1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground.
2. Place a resistance band just above your knees.
3. Engage your glutes and core muscles.
4. Press your heels into the ground and lift your hips off the floor, squeezing your glutes at the top.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your hips back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Push your knees outward against the band throughout the entire bridge movement to engage the glute medius in addition to the glute max.
- Drive through your heels, not your toes, and squeeze your glutes hard at the top of the lift for a full second.
- Place the band just above the knees for the best combination of glute activation and comfort.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the knees cave inward against the band resistance, which defeats the purpose of using the band.
- Hyperextending the lower back at the top instead of stopping when the hips are in line with the knees and shoulders.
- Using a band that is too light to provide meaningful resistance, turning it into a regular hip lift with no added benefit.
