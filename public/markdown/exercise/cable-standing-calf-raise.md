## How to perform

1. Stand facing a cable machine with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Hold onto the cable machine handles or attach a cable ankle strap to your ankles.
3. Raise your heels off the ground by extending your ankles as high as possible.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your heels back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Face the cable machine and attach a belt or rope around your hips, or hold the handle at waist height to create downward resistance.
- Rise up on your toes as high as possible and hold the top position for a full second before lowering.
- Keep your torso upright and avoid leaning forward, which shifts tension away from the calves.

## Common mistakes

- Standing too close to the machine, which reduces cable tension at the top of the movement.
- Bending the knees during the raise, turning it into a partial squat rather than a calf isolation exercise.
- Using too little weight because the cable setup feels unusual, when the calves can actually handle significant loads.
