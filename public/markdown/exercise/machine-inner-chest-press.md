## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height and position yourself on the machine with your back flat against the pad.
2. Grasp the handles with an overhand grip and position your elbows at a 90 degree angle.
3. Push the handles forward until your arms are fully extended, exhaling during the movement.
4. Pause for a moment at the end of the movement, then slowly return to the starting position, inhaling as you do so.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Squeeze your hands together at the end of each rep and hold for a one-count to maximize inner chest activation.
- Sit with your spine neutral against the pad and your chest lifted to keep the movement in the correct plane.
- Use a slow, controlled cadence, especially on the return, to prevent the weight stack from bouncing.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the elbows drop below the handles, which shifts stress to the shoulders rather than the inner chest.
- Not bringing the handles close enough together at the finish, cutting the contraction short.
- Leaning forward off the pad to use body weight as assistance on heavy reps.
