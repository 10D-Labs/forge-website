## How to perform

1. Sit on the edge of a chair or bench with your feet flat on the ground.
2. Extend one leg straight out in front of you, keeping your heel on the ground.
3. Lean forward slightly, feeling a stretch in your calf muscle.
4. Hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds.
5. Switch legs and repeat the stretch.

## Pro tips

- Extend the stretching leg fully and flex your foot back (pull toes toward your shin) to maximize the calf stretch.
- Lean forward from the hips with a flat back rather than rounding your spine to reach your toes.
- You can loop a towel around your foot and pull gently for a deeper stretch if you cannot reach your toes.

## Common mistakes

- Rounding the upper back excessively to try to reach further, which stretches the back instead of the calf.
- Bending the knee of the stretching leg, which slackens the gastrocnemius and reduces the stretch.
- Holding the stretch for too short a duration, less than 20 seconds.
