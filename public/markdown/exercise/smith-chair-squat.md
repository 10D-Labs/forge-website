- Keep your chest up and weight in your heels throughout the entire squat.
- The Smith machine bar should rest on your upper traps, not on your neck.

## Common mistakes

- Sitting fully onto the chair and relaxing at the bottom, which loses all muscle tension.
- Leaning too far forward because the bar is positioned too low on the back.
- Not squatting deep enough; the chair should be at a height that puts your thighs at least parallel.
