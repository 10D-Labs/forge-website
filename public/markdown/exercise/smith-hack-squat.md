## How to perform

1. Adjust the barbell on the smith machine to an appropriate height for your body.
2. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly pointed outwards.
3. Position yourself under the barbell, resting it on your upper traps and shoulders.
4. Grasp the barbell with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
5. Engage your core and keep your chest up as you unrack the barbell.
6. Take a step back and position your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
7. Bend your knees and lower your body down, keeping your chest up and back straight.
8. Continue descending until your thighs are parallel to the ground or slightly below.
9. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push through your heels to return to the starting position.
10. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Place your feet slightly forward of the bar to shift the emphasis to the quads rather than the glutes.
- Keep your core braced and your torso upright throughout the movement.
- Descend until your thighs are at least parallel to the floor for full quad activation.

## Common mistakes

- Placing the feet directly under the bar (as in a regular squat), which doesn't take advantage of the Hack Squat angle.
- Leaning forward excessively, which loads the lower back instead of the quads.
- Locking the knees at the top of each rep, which stresses the joint under load.
