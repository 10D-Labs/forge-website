## How to perform

1. Lie flat on your stomach with your legs extended and your arms by your sides.
2. Engage your glutes and hamstrings, and slowly lift your upper body off the ground, curling your back upwards.
3. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your upper body back down to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lift only your upper body, keeping your legs and hips pinned to the ground to isolate the spinal erectors.
- Move slowly and deliberately, raising to a comfortable height rather than hyperextending your spine.
- Place your hands behind your head or at your sides depending on the difficulty level you want.

## Common mistakes

- Hyperextending the lower back by lifting too high, which compresses the lumbar vertebrae.
- Using a jerky, fast motion instead of a slow controlled lift, risking a back strain.
- Lifting the legs off the floor simultaneously, which turns it into a full extension rather than an isolated Lower Back Curl.
