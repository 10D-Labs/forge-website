## How to perform

1. Lie flat on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing each other.
2. Extend your arms straight up over your chest, with a slight bend in your elbows.
3. Keeping a slight bend in your elbows, lower your arms out to the sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch in your chest.
4. Pause for a moment, then reverse the movement and bring the dumbbells back up to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lie flat on a bench with dumbbells pressed up, palms facing each other. Lower in a wide arc with a slight, fixed elbow bend until you feel a deep stretch across your chest.
- Think about hugging a large tree as you bring the dumbbells back together. The movement should be a sweeping arc, not a press.
- Do not let the dumbbells touch at the top. Stop when they are 2-3 inches apart to maintain chest tension.

## Common mistakes

- Bending the elbows too much and turning the fly into a press. The elbows should have a slight bend that stays constant.
- Going too heavy, which forces a pressing motion and reduces the chest isolation benefit.
- Not going deep enough to stretch the chest. The stretch at the bottom is where the most muscle fiber recruitment occurs.
