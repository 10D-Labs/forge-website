## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand at your sides.
2. Keeping your chest up and core engaged, lower your body down by bending at the knees and hips, as if sitting back into a chair.
3. Continue lowering until your thighs are parallel to the ground, or as low as you can comfortably go.
4. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push through your heels to return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hold the dumbbells at your sides (not on your shoulders) and sit back as if lowering into a chair, keeping weight in your heels.
- Push your knees outward in line with your toes as you descend to prevent them from caving inward.
- Descend until your thighs are at least parallel to the floor, then drive up through your heels to standing.

## Common mistakes

- Rising onto the toes during the squat, which shifts the load forward and stresses the knees.
- Rounding the lower back at the bottom of the squat, which puts the spine in a vulnerable position.
- Not squatting deep enough, which reduces glute activation and limits the range of motion.
