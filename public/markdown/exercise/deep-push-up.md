2. Lower your chest towards the ground by bending your elbows, keeping them close to your body.
3. Push through your palms to extend your arms and return to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Place your hands on dumbbells or Pushup handles to allow your chest to drop below hand level for increased range of motion.
- Lower until you feel a deep stretch in the chest, then press back up to full lockout.
- Keep your elbows at a 45-degree angle to your torso for optimal chest activation and shoulder safety.

## Common mistakes

- Going too deep too quickly without building up the range of motion gradually, which can strain the pec or shoulder.
- Flaring the elbows out to 90 degrees, which puts excessive stress on the shoulder joints at the deep position.
- Letting the hips sag, which puts the lower back at risk during the deep stretch.
