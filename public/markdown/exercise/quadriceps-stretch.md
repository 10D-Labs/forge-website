## How to perform

1. Start on all fours with your hands directly under your shoulders and your knees directly under your hips.
2. Extend one leg straight back, keeping your knee bent and your foot flexed.
3. Slowly lower your hips towards the ground, feeling a stretch in your quads.
4. Hold this position for 20-30 seconds.
5. Switch legs and repeat the stretch on the other side.

## Pro tips

- Keep your hips squared forward and avoid twisting as you lower them toward the ground.
- Engage your core to maintain a neutral pelvis; don't let your lower back arch excessively.
- Breathe deeply and let gravity assist the stretch rather than forcing your hips down.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the lower back hyperextend, which compresses the lumbar spine instead of stretching the quads.
- Twisting the hips to one side, which unevenly loads the stretch and can strain the hip flexor.
- Holding the stretch for too short a duration; you need at least 20 seconds for the muscle to begin relaxing.
