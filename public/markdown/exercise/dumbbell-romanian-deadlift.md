## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand with an overhand grip.
2. Keeping your back straight and your core engaged, hinge at the hips and lower the dumbbells towards the ground, allowing your knees to bend slightly.
3. Lower the dumbbells until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings, then push through your heels and engage your glutes to return to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep the dumbbells close to your legs throughout the movement, almost dragging them along your thighs and shins.
- Initiate the movement by pushing your hips back like you're closing a car door with your butt, not by bending your spine.
- Think about pulling yourself back to standing by squeezing your glutes rather than lifting with your lower back.

## Common mistakes

- Rounding the lower back as you descend, which puts dangerous shear force on the lumbar spine.
- Bending the knees too much, turning the RDL into a conventional Deadlift and reducing Hamstring Stretch.
- Looking up excessively, which hyperextends the cervical spine; keep your neck neutral by looking at a spot about 6 feet ahead on the floor.
