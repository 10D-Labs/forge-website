## Pro tips

- Press your lower back into the floor and use your abs to curl your knees toward your chest, lifting the hips off the ground.
- Keep the movement small and controlled rather than using leg momentum to swing your hips up.
- Exhale forcefully as you lift your hips to maximize abdominal contraction.

## Common mistakes

- Using momentum to rock the hips up instead of deliberately contracting the lower abs.
- Pressing down with the hands too hard, which lets the arms do the work instead of the abs.
- Extending the legs too far at the bottom, causing the lower back to arch off the ground.
