## How to perform

1. Sit on the ground with your legs extended in front of you and your back straight.
2. Wrap the band around your waist and hold the ends with both hands.
3. Engage your abs and slowly twist your torso to one side, keeping your back straight and your feet on the ground.
4. Pause for a moment at the end of the twist, then slowly return to the starting position.
5. Repeat the twist to the other side.
6. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Sit with a tall spine and twist from the ribcage, not the hips, to target the obliques.
- Keep the band taut throughout the entire range of motion for constant tension.
- Control the rotation in both directions rather than letting the band pull you back to center.

## Common mistakes

- Rounding the back and slouching as you twist, which reduces oblique engagement and loads the spine poorly.
- Moving only the arms without actually rotating the torso.
- Twisting too far, which can strain the lower back when done under resistance.
