## How to perform

1. Start in a pushup position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
2. Extend one arm straight out to the side, parallel to the ground.
3. Lower your body by bending your elbows, keeping your back straight and core engaged.
4. Push back up to the starting position.
5. Repeat on the other side, extending the opposite arm out to the side.
6. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Place your hands roughly double shoulder width apart, with the working arm doing most of the pressing.
- Keep the extended arm as straight as possible with fingers pointing outward to stretch the chest.
- Lower your chest toward the working hand, not to the center, to maximize unilateral loading.

## Common mistakes

- Bending the extended arm significantly, which distributes the load too evenly and defeats the purpose.
- Rotating the torso toward the working arm instead of keeping the chest facing the floor.
- Placing hands too close together, which limits the range and makes the movement feel like a standard wide Pushup.
