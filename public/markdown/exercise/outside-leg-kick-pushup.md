## How to perform

1. Start in a pushup position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and your feet together.
2. Lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows, keeping your back straight and core engaged.
3. As you push back up, kick one leg out to the side, extending it fully and engaging your glutes.
4. Return your leg to the starting position and repeat the pushup, alternating legs with each repetition.
5. Continue alternating leg kicks and pushup for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Kick the leg out with control and squeeze the glute at full extension before returning to the Pushup position.
- Keep your hips level throughout the kick; don't rotate or let the opposite hip drop.
- Brace your core hard during the kick phase to maintain a stable plank position.

## Common mistakes

- Rushing the leg kick and not actually achieving full hip extension, which reduces glute activation.
- Letting the hips rotate open during the side kick instead of keeping the pelvis square to the floor.
- Collapsing the Pushup form (sagging hips, flared elbows) because of the added complexity of the kick.
