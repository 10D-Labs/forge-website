## How to perform

1. Stand facing a cable machine with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Hold the cable attachment with both hands, palms facing each other, and step back to create tension in the cable.
3. Keep your back straight and your core engaged.
4. Pull the cable towards your body, squeezing your shoulder blades together.
5. Pause for a moment at the peak of the movement, then slowly release the cable back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Set the cable at upper chest to face height and use a rope attachment. Pull toward your face with your elbows high, finishing with your hands beside your ears.
- Externally rotate your shoulders at the end of each rep by pulling the rope apart, which activates the rotator cuff and rear delts simultaneously.
- Lean back slightly to counterbalance the weight rather than standing straight, which helps maintain proper form.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling the rope to your chest instead of your face, which turns this into a row and misses the rear delt and rotator cuff benefits.
- Keeping the elbows low, which shifts emphasis to the lats and biceps instead of the rear delts and external rotators.
- Using too much weight and compensating by leaning back excessively or using body momentum.
