## How to perform

1. Start in a pushup position with your hands shoulder-width apart and your feet together.
2. Bend your elbows and lower your body towards the ground, keeping your back straight.
3. As you lower your body, lift your feet off the ground and bring your knees towards your chest.
4. Hold this position for a few seconds, then extend your legs back out and push yourself back up to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Place your knees on the outside of your elbows (not on top) and lean forward until your feet naturally lift off the ground.
- Spread your fingers wide and press the floor away to create a stable base.
- Start with brief 5-10 second holds and build endurance gradually to protect your wrists.

## Common mistakes

- Placing the knees on top of the elbows rather than resting them on the outside or the tricep shelf.
- Not leaning forward enough, making it impossible to lift the feet and find the balance point.
- Gripping the floor with bent fingers instead of pressing through flat palms, which strains the finger joints.
