## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder height.
2. Press one dumbbell overhead while keeping the other dumbbell at shoulder height.
3. Lower the pressed dumbbell back to shoulder height while pressing the other dumbbell overhead.
4. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Press one dumbbell overhead while holding the other at shoulder height. This alternating pattern challenges your core to resist lateral tilting.
- Brace your core hard to prevent your torso from leaning toward the non-pressing side. The anti-lateral-flexion demand is a key benefit of this exercise.
- Press in a slight arc outward and upward, not straight up, to follow the natural shoulder pressing path.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning the torso away from the pressing arm, which compensates for weak shoulder strength and reduces core engagement.
- Pressing too quickly and losing the alternating rhythm, which reduces the stabilization demand.
- Arching the lower back as fatigue sets in, which stresses the lumbar spine.
