## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a kettlebell close to your chest with both hands.
2. Keeping your chest up and core engaged, lower your body down into a squat position by bending at the knees and hips.
3. Continue lowering until your thighs are parallel to the ground, or as low as you can comfortably go.
4. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push through your heels to return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hold the kettlebell by the horns (sides of the handle) close to your chest, pulling it into your body to counterbalance the squat.
- Use your elbows to push your knees out at the bottom of the squat, which opens the hips and allows a deeper squat.
- Drive up through your whole foot, not just the heels, and squeeze your glutes at the top.

## Common mistakes

- Holding the kettlebell too far from the body, which pulls the torso forward and stresses the lower back.
- Squatting with the knees caving inward instead of tracking over the toes.
- Not going deep enough. The goblet squat is designed for depth, so aim to get your elbows inside your knees at the bottom.
