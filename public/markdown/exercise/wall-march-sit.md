## How to perform

1. Stand with your back against a wall and your feet hip-width apart.
2. Slowly slide your back down the wall until your knees are bent at a 90 degree angle.
3. Lift your right foot off the ground and bring your knee towards your chest.
4. Lower your right foot back down and lift your left foot off the ground, bringing your knee towards your chest.
5. Continue alternating between lifting your right and left foot for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your back flat against the wall with your thighs parallel to the ground the entire time.
- March your knees up slowly and deliberately; speed reduces the isometric hold benefit on the quads and glutes.
- Breathe steadily throughout the exercise; holding your breath will cause you to fatigue faster.

## Common mistakes

- Sliding up the wall as fatigue sets in, which reduces the knee angle and makes the exercise easier.
- Placing the feet too close to the wall, which puts excessive stress on the knees instead of loading the quads and glutes.
- Raising the knees only slightly instead of bringing them to hip height for full hip flexor engagement.
