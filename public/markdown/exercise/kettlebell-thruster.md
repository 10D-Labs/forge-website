## How to perform

1. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a kettlebell in front of your chest with both hands, palms facing each other.
2. Lower into a squat position by bending your knees and pushing your hips back, keeping your chest up and your back straight.
3. As you reach the bottom of the squat, explosively drive through your heels to stand up, simultaneously pressing the kettlebell overhead.
4. Lock out your arms at the top of the movement, fully extending your elbows.
5. Lower the kettlebell back to the starting position by reversing the movement, bending your elbows and lowering the weight back to your chest.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Squat all the way to parallel or below before driving up. The thruster's power comes from the deep squat position.
- Time the press so it happens as your legs reach full extension. The momentum from standing up should seamlessly transition into the overhead press.
- Lock out overhead with your biceps by your ears before pulling the bell back to the rack and squatting again.

## Common mistakes

- Not squatting deep enough, which reduces the leg drive available for the press portion.
- Pressing the kettlebell before the legs have fully extended, wasting the momentum from the squat.
- Letting the kettlebell pull you forward in the squat because of poor rack position.
