## How to Perform Kettlebell Thruster

1. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a kettlebell in front of your chest with both hands, palms facing each other.
2. Lower into a squat position by bending your knees and pushing your hips back, keeping your chest up and your back straight.
3. As you reach the bottom of the squat, explosively drive through your heels to stand up, simultaneously pressing the kettlebell overhead.
4. Lock out your arms at the top of the movement, fully extending your elbows.
5. Lower the kettlebell back to the starting position by reversing the movement, bending your elbows and lowering the weight back to your chest.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
