## How to perform

1. Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a barbell with an overhand grip, palms facing down.
2. Keep your upper arms stationary and exhale as you curl the barbell upward, contracting your biceps.
3. Continue to raise the barbell until your biceps are fully contracted and the barbell is at shoulder level.
4. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
5. Inhale as you slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position, keeping your upper arms stationary.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use an overhand (pronated) grip with your thumbs on top to target the brachioradialis and brachialis in addition to the biceps.
- Keep your wrists straight and rigid throughout the curl; don't let them bend backward under the load.
- Use lighter weight than you would for standard curls since the overhand grip reduces bicep leverage.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the wrists bend backward (extend) at the top, which shifts load to the forearm extensors and can cause wrist pain.
- Using the same weight as standard curls, which forces you to cheat with body swing.
- Swinging the body to generate momentum because the grip position makes the exercise feel harder.

## FAQ

### What's the difference between reverse curls and regular curls?

Reverse curls use an overhand grip (palms down), which shifts emphasis to the brachioradialis (top of the forearm) and brachialis (underneath the biceps). Regular curls use an underhand grip that maximizes bicep peak activation.

### Do reverse curls build forearm size?

Yes. They're one of the best exercises for the brachioradialis, the large muscle on the top of the forearm. Combined with wrist curls, they provide complete forearm development.

### Should I include reverse curls in my arm routine?

Absolutely. Most people only do standard curls, which undertrain the brachioradialis and brachialis. Adding 2-3 sets of reverse curls builds more complete arm development and improves grip strength.

### What muscles does the Barbell Reverse Curl work?

The Barbell Reverse Curl primarily targets the biceps, with secondary activation in the forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.

### Is the Barbell Reverse Curl good for beginners?

Yes, the Barbell Reverse Curl is rated as a beginner-level exercise. It's a great starting point for building biceps strength.
