4. Keep your knees in line with your toes and your weight in your heels.
5. Lower until your thighs are parallel to the ground, or as low as you can comfortably go.

## Pro tips

- Wrap the bar with a towel or use a squat pad in the elbow crook to reduce discomfort on the forearms.
- Brace your core as if taking a punch before descending; the front-loaded position demands extreme trunk stability.
- Drive your elbows up and forward as you stand to prevent the bar from sliding down your arms.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the elbows drop as you descend, which shifts the bar forward and pulls you off balance.
- Using too much weight before mastering the movement pattern; the Zercher position limits how much you can safely hold.
- Rounding the upper back under load, which puts dangerous stress on the thoracic spine.
