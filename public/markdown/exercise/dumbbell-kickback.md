## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand.
2. Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight.
3. Bring your upper arms close to your sides, with your elbows bent at a 90 degree angle.
4. Extend your arms straight back, squeezing your triceps at the top of the movement.
5. Pause for a moment, then slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lock your upper arm parallel to the floor and only move from the elbow down to fully isolate the triceps.
- Squeeze hard at full extension and hold for a beat to maximize the peak contraction where the triceps are shortest.
- Hinge forward at the hips at least 45 degrees to keep gravity working against the triceps throughout the full range of motion.

## Common mistakes

- Dropping the upper arm below parallel, which removes tension from the triceps at the most important part of the movement.
- Swinging the dumbbell back using shoulder momentum rather than extending purely from the elbow.
- Using too heavy a weight and only achieving a partial range of motion, never reaching full elbow extension.

## FAQ

### What weight should I use for tricep kickbacks?

Most people use 10-25 lbs. This is an isolation exercise that relies on strict form, not heavy loads. If you need to swing the weight, go lighter.

### Should I do kickbacks with both arms at once or one at a time?

Both work, but single-arm kickbacks let you brace with the free hand for better stability and stricter form.

The Dumbbell Kickback primarily targets the triceps, with secondary activation in the shoulders. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.
