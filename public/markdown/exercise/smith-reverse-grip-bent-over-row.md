## How to perform

1. Set up the smith machine with the bar at hip height.
2. Stand facing the bar with your feet shoulder-width apart.
3. Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight.
4. Grasp the bar with an underhand grip, hands shoulder-width apart.
5. Pull the bar towards your lower chest, squeezing your shoulder blades together.
6. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the bar back down to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use an underhand shoulder-width grip to maximize lat and biceps engagement while keeping stress off the wrists.
- Pull the bar toward your belly button rather than your chest to follow the natural path of lat contraction.
- Keep your torso angle consistent at roughly 45 degrees and resist the urge to stand up during heavy pulls.

## Common mistakes

- Gripping too wide with a reverse grip, which strains the wrists and reduces pulling efficiency.
- Straightening the torso to nearly upright during the pull, which turns the row into a shrug.
- Yanking the bar up with arm strength instead of initiating the movement with scapular retraction.
