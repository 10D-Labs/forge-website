2. Engage your core and lift your right hand off the ground, reaching across to tap your left shoulder.
3. Place your right hand back on the ground and repeat with your left hand tapping your right shoulder.
4. Continue alternating shoulder taps while keeping your hips and torso stable.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Widen your feet to hip-width or wider for more stability during each tap.
- Minimize hip rotation by bracing your core hard before lifting each hand off the ground.
- Move slowly and deliberately; each tap should take 1-2 seconds, not a quick flick.

## Common mistakes

- Rocking the hips side to side with each tap, which means the core isn't doing its job.
- Placing the hands too close together, which creates an unstable base.
- Rushing through the taps and losing the anti-rotation benefit of the exercise.
