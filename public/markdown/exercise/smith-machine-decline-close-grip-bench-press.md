2. Lie down on the bench with your feet firmly planted on the ground.
3. Grasp the barbell with a close grip, slightly narrower than shoulder-width apart.
4. Unrack the barbell and lower it slowly towards your chest, keeping your elbows close to your body.
5. Pause for a moment when the barbell is just above your chest.
6. Push the barbell back up to the starting position, fully extending your arms.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Secure your legs firmly on the decline bench pad before unracking to prevent sliding.
- Keep your grip about shoulder-width apart and tuck your elbows at a 30-degree angle from your body.
- Touch the bar to your lower chest, pause for a beat, then press explosively to lockout.

## Common mistakes

- Gripping too narrow, which puts excessive strain on the wrists and reduces the weight you can handle.
- Flaring the elbows out, which shifts emphasis from the triceps to the chest.
- Not locking out fully at the top, which skips the strongest part of the tricep contraction.
