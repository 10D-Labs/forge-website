## Pro tips

- Rest your forearms on a bench with only your wrists and hands hanging off the edge. This isolates the wrist extensors completely.
- Use very light weight and high reps (15-25) since the wrist extensors are small muscles that respond to volume and endurance training.
- Curl your wrists upward as high as possible and hold the top position for a one-second squeeze.

## Common mistakes

- Using too much weight, which limits the range of motion and can strain the small tendons around the wrist.
- Moving the forearms during the curl instead of keeping them pressed flat against the bench.
- Performing the reps too quickly without a pause at the top, which reduces time under tension for the wrist extensors.
