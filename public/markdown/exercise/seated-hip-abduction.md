## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height so that your knees are at a 90 degree angle.
2. Sit on the machine with your back against the backrest and your feet on the footrests.
3. Place your hands on the side handles for stability.
4. Engage your abductors and slowly push your legs apart, away from the midline of your body.
5. Pause for a moment at the end of the movement, then slowly bring your legs back together to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Push outward through the outside of your knees rather than your feet to better engage the glute medius.
- Hold the fully open position for 1-2 seconds to maximize time under tension on the abductors.
- Sit upright or lean slightly forward to shift more emphasis to the gluteus medius.

## Common mistakes

- Using momentum to swing the legs apart instead of controlling the movement with the abductors.
- Leaning back excessively, which reduces the range of motion and takes tension off the target muscles.
- Going too heavy and only achieving a partial range of motion.
