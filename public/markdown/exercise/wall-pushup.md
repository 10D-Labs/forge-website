## Pro tips

- Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels, just like a regular Pushup, but at an angle.
- Place your hands at chest height on the wall, slightly wider than shoulder width, for the best chest activation.
- Control the tempo: 2 seconds down, 1 second pause at the wall, 2 seconds pushing back.

## Common mistakes

- Standing too close to the wall, which makes the movement too easy and limits range of motion.
- Letting the hips sag forward or pike up instead of maintaining a rigid plank line.
- Flaring the elbows out to 90 degrees instead of keeping them at about 45 degrees from the torso.
