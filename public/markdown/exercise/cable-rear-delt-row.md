## How to perform

1. Attach a stirrup handle to a low cable pulley and stand facing the machine.
2. Grasp the handle with your left hand and take a step back with your right foot, positioning your body at a slight angle.
3. Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight and your core engaged.
4. With your left arm extended and your palm facing down, pull the handle towards your chest by retracting your shoulder blade.
5. Pause for a moment at the top of the movement, squeezing your shoulder blade.
6. Slowly release the handle back to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
7. Switch sides and repeat the exercise with your right arm.

## Pro tips

- Pull the handle toward your face level, not your waist. The high pull angle is what isolates the rear delt rather than the lats.
- Flare your elbow out wide at approximately 90 degrees from your torso to shift emphasis onto the posterior deltoid.
- Use a lighter weight than you would for standard rows. The rear delt is a small muscle that responds better to controlled reps than heavy loads.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling to the waist with the elbow tight to the body, which turns this into a standard cable row targeting the lats.
- Using too much weight and compensating with torso rotation and momentum.
- Not hinging far enough forward, which shifts the load to the lateral delts and traps.

The rear delts recover quickly and can be trained 2-3 times per week. They are often underdeveloped compared to the front and lateral delts, so frequent training helps balance shoulder development.
