## Pro tips

- Let the dumbbells hang straight down at full arm extension to get a complete lat stretch before each pull.
- Use an underhand grip with palms facing forward to increase biceps activation and allow a longer pulling range.
- Keep your chest pressed firmly into the bench pad to isolate the back and prevent lower back compensation.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling the dumbbells too high toward the shoulders instead of the lower ribcage, which overloads the rear delts rather than the lats.
- Peeling the chest off the bench to use body English on heavy reps.
- Using a grip that is too wide, which reduces the mechanical advantage of the underhand position.
