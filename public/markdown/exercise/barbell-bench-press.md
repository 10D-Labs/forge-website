## How to perform

1. Lie flat on a bench with your feet flat on the ground and your back pressed against the bench.
2. Grasp the barbell with an overhand grip slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3. Lift the barbell off the rack and hold it directly above your chest with your arms fully extended.
4. Lower the barbell slowly towards your chest, keeping your elbows tucked in.
5. Pause for a moment when the barbell touches your chest.
6. Push the barbell back up to the starting position by extending your arms.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Plant your feet firmly, retract your shoulder blades, and create a slight arch in your upper back to stabilize your pressing platform.
- Lower the bar to your lower chest (nipple line) with a controlled 2-3 second descent, keeping your elbows at about 45 degrees from your torso.
- Drive the bar up and slightly back toward the rack so it finishes over your shoulder joint, not over your face or stomach.

## Common mistakes

- Flaring the elbows out to 90 degrees, which puts excessive stress on the shoulder joint and reduces pressing power.
- Bouncing the bar off the chest to generate momentum instead of pausing briefly at the bottom.
- Lifting the hips off the bench during heavy reps, which compromises the setup and can strain the lower back.

Use a power rack with safety pins set just below your chest height. Alternatively, learn the 'roll of shame' where you roll the bar down your torso to your hips and sit up. Never bench heavy without either a spotter or safeties.
