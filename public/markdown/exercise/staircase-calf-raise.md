## How to perform

1. Stand on the edge of a step or a sturdy platform with your heels hanging off and your toes on the step.
2. Hold onto a railing or wall for balance if needed.
3. Slowly raise your heels as high as possible, lifting your body weight onto the balls of your feet.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your heels back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Let your heels drop below the step at the bottom to get a full stretch on the Achilles tendon and calf muscle.
- Pause for 2 seconds at the top of each rep and squeeze hard to maximize the peak contraction.
- Perform the exercise slowly, taking 2 seconds up and 3 seconds down, to keep the calves under tension longer.

## Common mistakes

- Bouncing at the bottom of the movement, which uses the Achilles tendon like a spring instead of working the calf muscle.
- Not allowing the heels to drop fully below the step, which limits the range of motion and reduces the stretch benefit.
- Leaning forward and shifting weight to the toes of the wrong part of the foot; press through the balls of your feet.
