## How to perform

1. Lie flat on a flat bench with your back pressed against it.
2. Place your hands under your glutes for support.
3. Keep your legs straight and together, and lift them up towards the ceiling.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Grip the bench behind your head firmly and press your lower back into the bench throughout the movement.
- Raise your legs until they're perpendicular to the floor, then lower them slowly without letting your lower back arch off the bench.
- For extra intensity, pause at the bottom of the rep with your legs hovering just above bench height.

## Common mistakes

- Allowing the lower back to arch off the bench as the legs lower, which stresses the lumbar spine.
- Using momentum to swing the legs up instead of lifting with controlled abdominal contraction.
- Bending the knees excessively during the lift, which shortens the lever arm and reduces ab engagement.

## FAQ

### Why does my lower back hurt during lying leg raises?

Your lower back is arching off the bench, meaning your abs aren't strong enough to stabilize your pelvis at that range. Lower your legs only as far as you can while keeping your lower back pressed flat against the bench.

### What's the difference between lying leg raises on a bench vs the floor?

The bench allows you to lower your legs slightly below parallel, increasing range of motion and difficulty. The floor limits the bottom range but is easier on the lower back.

### Are lying leg raises a hip flexor or ab exercise?

Both muscles are involved. The hip flexors lift the legs, but the abs work isometrically to keep the pelvis stable. To maximize ab involvement, focus on pressing your lower back into the bench and controlling the movement.

### What muscles does the Lying Leg Raise Flat Bench work?

The Lying Leg Raise Flat Bench primarily targets the abs, with secondary activation in the hip flexors. It's classified as a strength exercise for the core.

### Is the Lying Leg Raise Flat Bench good for beginners?

The Lying Leg Raise Flat Bench is rated as intermediate. Beginners should build a base of abs strength with easier variations first.
