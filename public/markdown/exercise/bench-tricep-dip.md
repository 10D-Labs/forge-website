## How to perform

1. Sit on the edge of a bench with your hands gripping the edge, fingers pointing forward.
2. Walk your feet forward, sliding your butt off the bench, and straighten your arms.
3. Bend your elbows and lower your body towards the ground, keeping your back close to the bench.
4. Push through your palms to straighten your arms and return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your back close to the bench throughout the movement to maximize tricep activation and minimize shoulder strain.
- Control the descent for a 2-3 second count rather than dropping quickly into the bottom position.
- Press through the heel of your palms, not your fingers, to protect your wrists.

## Common mistakes

- Flaring the elbows out wide, which shifts the load from the triceps to the shoulders and increases injury risk.
- Dipping too deep past 90 degrees of elbow flexion, which places excessive stress on the anterior shoulder capsule.
- Walking the feet too far out so the hips sag, reducing tricep engagement.
