## How to perform

1. Start in a high plank position with your hands on the medicine ball, shoulder-width apart.
2. Lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows, keeping them close to your sides.
3. Push back up to the starting position, fully extending your arms.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Place both hands on top of the medicine ball, close together, with fingers wrapped around the sides for grip.
- Keep your core tight and body in a straight line; the unstable surface will challenge your stabilizers.
- Lower your chest to the ball slowly, then press back up with control to avoid slipping.

## Common mistakes

- Placing hands on the sides of the ball instead of on top, which changes the exercise mechanics and reduces tricep emphasis.
- Letting the hips sag due to the instability of the ball, which puts the lower back at risk.
- Rushing through reps on an unstable surface, increasing the chance of the ball rolling and causing a fall.
