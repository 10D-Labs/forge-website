## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and hold a kettlebell in each hand with your palms facing your body.
2. Bend forward at the hips, keeping your back straight and your core engaged.
3. Pull one kettlebell up towards your chest, keeping your elbow close to your body and squeezing your shoulder blades together.
4. Lower the kettlebell back down to the starting position and repeat with the other arm.
5. Continue alternating arms for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hinge forward at the hips about 45 degrees with a flat back, letting the kettlebells hang directly below your shoulders.
- Row one kettlebell at a time while keeping the other arm extended. This challenges anti-rotation stability.
- Squeeze the shoulder blade back and hold for one second at the top of each row.

## Common mistakes

- Rounding the upper back during the hinge, which reduces upper back activation and risks lower back strain.
- Jerking the kettlebell up with body rotation rather than pulling with the back muscles.
- Standing too upright, which turns the row into a curl-like movement.
