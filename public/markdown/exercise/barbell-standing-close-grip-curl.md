## How to perform

1. Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a barbell with an underhand grip, hands close together.
2. Keep your elbows close to your torso and your upper arms stationary throughout the movement.
3. Exhale as you curl the weights while contracting your biceps. Continue to raise the bar until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level.
4. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
5. Inhale as you slowly begin to bring the barbell back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Position your hands 6-8 inches apart on the bar to emphasize the outer (long) head of the biceps.
- Keep your elbows pinned to your sides and your upper body completely still throughout the curl.
- Squeeze the biceps hard at the top and lower slowly for 2-3 seconds to maximize the eccentric stimulus.

## Common mistakes

- Placing the hands too close together (touching), which strains the wrists without additional bicep benefit.
- Swinging the torso to generate momentum as the set gets harder.
- Cutting the range of motion short at the bottom by not fully extending the arms.
