## Pro tips

- Start with a posterior Pelvic Tilt (flatten your lower back to the floor) before driving your hips up into the bridge.

- Pushing through the toes instead of the heels, shifting the work to the quads and calves.
- Letting the hips drop quickly on the way down instead of controlling the descent.
