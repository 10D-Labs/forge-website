## How to perform

1. Stand in front of a step or platform with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing your sides.
2. Place your right foot on the step, ensuring your entire foot is on the surface.
3. Push through your right heel and lift your body up onto the step, bringing your left foot up as well.
4. Once both feet are on the step, lower your left foot back down to the starting position, keeping your right foot on the step.
5. Repeat the movement, alternating which foot you step up with each time.
6. Continue for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Drive through the heel of the foot on the step, not the toes, to engage the glutes and quads fully.
- Keep your torso upright throughout both the step-up and lunge portions of the movement.
- Control the step-down phase rather than dropping; the eccentric is where much of the muscle-building benefit happens.

## Common mistakes

- Pushing off the back foot to assist the step-up, which reduces the training effect on the front leg.
- Using a step that is too high, which causes the torso to lean forward excessively and strains the lower back.
- Letting the knee of the stepping leg collapse inward, which puts dangerous stress on the knee joint.
