## How to perform

1. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly turned out.
2. Hold the barbell in front of your chest with your hands shoulder-width apart, elbows pointing forward.
3. Engage your core and keep your chest up as you lower your body down into a squat position, pushing your hips back and bending your knees.
4. Lower until your thighs are parallel to the ground, or as low as you can comfortably go.
5. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push through your heels to return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hold the bar at chest height with your elbows pointing forward and up to keep the bar securely in the front rack.
- Maintain a very upright torso throughout; if you lean forward, the bar will roll off your chest.
- Push your knees out over your toes and keep your weight on your full foot as you descend.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the elbows drop, causing the bar to slide forward and downward off the chest.
- Leaning too far forward, which turns this into a good morning pattern and stresses the lower back.
- Not going deep enough because the upright torso position feels awkward at first.

## FAQ

### What's the difference between a front chest squat and a regular front squat?

The upright torso position in front squats generally puts less shear force on the knees compared to back squats. The knees travel further forward, but the load is distributed differently.

The front-loaded position limits how much you can lean forward, demanding more from your quads and core. You'll typically front squat 70-85% of your back squat weight.
