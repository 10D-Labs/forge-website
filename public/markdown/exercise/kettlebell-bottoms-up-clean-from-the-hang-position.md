- Use a smooth, controlled hip drive rather than an aggressive snap. Too much force makes it harder to stabilize the bell in the bottoms-up position.
- Keep your wrist straight and directly under the bottom of the kettlebell at the catch position.

## Common mistakes

- Using too heavy a kettlebell for the bottoms-up position. Start very light (8-12 kg) until you master the balance.
- Catching the kettlebell with a bent wrist, which puts the forearm at a mechanical disadvantage and risks wrist injury.
