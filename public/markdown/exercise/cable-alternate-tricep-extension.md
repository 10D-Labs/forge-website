## How to perform

1. Stand facing the cable machine with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Hold the cable handle with your right hand and bring your arm up so that your upper arm is parallel to the ground and your elbow is bent at a 90 degree angle.
3. Keep your upper arm stationary and extend your forearm backward, fully straightening your arm.
4. Pause for a moment, then slowly return to the starting position.
5. Repeat with your left arm.
6. Continue alternating arms for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Set the pulley above head height and keep your upper arm stationary while extending one forearm at a time.
- Fully lock out each rep and squeeze the tricep hard for a one-second hold at the bottom.
- Keep your elbow pointed straight down and don't let it drift forward or backward during the extension.

## Common mistakes

- Moving the entire arm instead of isolating the movement to the forearm, which involves the shoulders.
- Using too much weight and leaning forward to push the handle down with body weight.
- Alternating too quickly without fully contracting the tricep on each arm.

## FAQ

### Why alternate arms instead of using both at once?

Alternating arms forces each tricep to work independently, preventing the stronger arm from compensating for the weaker one. It also doubles the time under tension per set since each arm works while the other rests.

### What attachment should I use for cable Tricep Extensions?

A single handle or rope attachment works best for alternating extensions. The single handle allows full pronation or supination at the bottom for a better tricep squeeze.

### Where should I feel cable Tricep Extensions?

Along the back of your upper arm, from just above the elbow to the shoulder. If you feel it in your shoulders or chest, your elbow is moving too much or the cable is set too low.

### What muscles does the Cable Alternate Tricep Extension work?

The Cable Alternate Tricep Extension primarily targets the triceps, with secondary activation in the shoulders. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.

### Is the Cable Alternate Tricep Extension good for beginners?

The Cable Alternate Tricep Extension is rated as intermediate. Beginners should build a base of triceps strength with easier variations first.
