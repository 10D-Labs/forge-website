## Pro tips

- Step diagonally behind and across your body, landing on the ball of your back foot.
- Keep your front knee tracking over your second toe; don't let it collapse inward.
- Push back to the starting position through the heel of your front foot.

## Common mistakes

- Not stepping far enough behind and across, which reduces the glute medius activation that makes this exercise unique.
- Letting the front knee cave inward as you descend, which puts stress on the knee ligaments.
- Leaning the torso too far forward instead of staying upright throughout the movement.
