## How to perform

1. Attach the handles to the low pulleys of a cable machine and select an appropriate weight.
2. Stand in the middle of the machine with your feet shoulder-width apart and a slight bend in your knees.
3. Grasp the handles with an overhand grip and extend your arms out to the sides, keeping a slight bend in your elbows.
4. Maintaining control, slowly bring your arms forward in a sweeping motion, crossing them in front of your body.
5. Pause for a moment at the peak of the movement, feeling the stretch in your chest muscles.
6. Reverse the motion and slowly return your arms to the starting position, keeping tension on your chest muscles throughout.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Set the pulleys at the lowest position and use a staggered stance for stability. The upward angle targets the upper chest fibers specifically.
- Maintain a fixed slight bend in your elbows throughout the movement. Do not let your elbows straighten or bend further during the rep.
- Bring your hands together at about chin height and squeeze for a one-second hold to maximize upper chest contraction.

## Common mistakes

- Setting the pulleys too high, which turns this into a middle or low cable fly instead of an incline variation targeting the upper chest.
- Bending the elbows too much during the movement, which converts the fly into a pressing motion.
- Bringing the hands together too low (at stomach level), which misses the incline angle needed for upper chest emphasis.
