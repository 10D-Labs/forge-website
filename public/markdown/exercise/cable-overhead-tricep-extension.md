## How to perform

1. Attach a rope to a high pulley and stand facing away from the machine.
2. Grasp the rope with both hands and extend your arms overhead.
3. Keep your elbows close to your head and your upper arms stationary.
4. Slowly lower the rope behind your head by bending your elbows.
5. Pause for a moment, then extend your arms back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Take one step away from the machine and lean slightly forward to keep the cable path aligned with your triceps.
- Keep your elbows close to your head and pointed forward throughout the movement.
- Extend your arms fully overhead and squeeze the triceps at lockout before bending the elbows again.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the elbows flare out to the sides, which reduces the stretch on the long head of the triceps.
- Standing too upright, which changes the angle of pull and reduces the effectiveness of the overhead position.
- Using excessive weight that pulls you backward, causing you to arch your lower back.

## FAQ

### Why is the overhead position important for Tricep Extensions?

The overhead position puts the long head of the triceps in a stretched position, which research shows leads to greater muscle activation and growth compared to pushdown-only movements.

### Should I use a rope or straight bar?

The rope is preferred because it allows your wrists to move naturally and you can spread the rope at the top for an extra contraction. A straight bar works but is less wrist-friendly.

### How do I prevent lower back pain during this exercise?

Stagger your stance with one foot in front of the other, brace your core tightly, and use a weight you can control without arching your back.

### What muscles does the Cable Overhead Tricep Extension work?

The Cable Overhead Tricep Extension primarily targets the triceps, with secondary activation in the shoulders. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.

### Is the Cable Overhead Tricep Extension good for beginners?

The Cable Overhead Tricep Extension is rated as intermediate. Beginners should build a base of triceps strength with easier variations first.
