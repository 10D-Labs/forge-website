## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat and footplate of the leg press machine to a comfortable position.
2. Sit on the leg press machine with your back against the backrest and your feet shoulder-width apart on the footplate.
3. Grip the handles on the sides of the seat for stability.
4. Push the footplate away from your body by extending your legs, keeping your heels on the footplate.
5. Continue pushing until your legs are almost fully extended, but without locking your knees.
6. Pause for a moment at the top of the movement, then slowly lower the footplate back towards your body by bending your knees.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Position your feet shoulder-width apart in the center of the platform; higher foot placement targets glutes more, lower targets quads more.
- Press through your heels to maximize glute and hamstring activation rather than pushing through the toes.
- Stop lowering when your lower back starts to round off the pad (the 'butt wink') to protect your lumbar spine.

## Common mistakes

- Lowering the sled too far, causing the lower back to round off the pad, which puts the lumbar spine at risk.
- Locking the knees fully at the top of the press, which shifts all the load onto the joint instead of the muscles.
- Placing the feet too low on the platform, which puts excessive stress on the knees.
