## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a kettlebell in one hand at shoulder level.
2. Bend your knees slightly and engage your core.
3. Press the kettlebell overhead by extending your arm and fully extending your legs.
4. Lower the kettlebell back to the starting position by bending your knees and bringing the kettlebell back to your shoulder.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch sides.

## Pro tips

- Start with the kettlebell in a solid rack position with your elbow tight to your body and the bell resting against your forearm and upper arm.
- Dip quickly by bending your knees 4-6 inches, then drive hard through your legs to launch the kettlebell upward.
- Time the arm extension to catch the momentum from the leg drive. The arm finishes the press, but the legs initiate the power.

## Common mistakes

- Dipping too deep, which wastes time and energy and breaks the rhythm of the explosive drive.
- Leaning back during the press instead of staying vertical and letting the legs do the initial work.
- Not using any leg drive at all, making it a strict press instead of a push press.
