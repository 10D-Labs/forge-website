## How to perform

1. Lie face down on a mat or bench with your legs fully extended.
2. use a machine to or use a resistance band to secure your ankles.
3. Engage your hamstrings and lift your legs towards your glutes, keeping your knees straight.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your hips pressed firmly into the pad or bench throughout the movement to isolate the hamstrings and prevent your lower back from taking over.
- Curl the weight up explosively, then lower it slowly over 3-4 seconds for maximum hamstring growth.
- Point your toes slightly away from your shins (plantar flexion) to reduce calf involvement and increase hamstring isolation.

## Common mistakes

- Lifting the hips off the pad at the top of the curl, which recruits the lower back and glutes instead of isolating the hamstrings.
- Using too much weight and only performing partial reps, missing the full stretch at the bottom.
- Jerking the weight up rather than using a controlled, smooth curling motion.
