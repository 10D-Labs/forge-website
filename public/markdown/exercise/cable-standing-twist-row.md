## Pro tips

- Pull the V-bar toward your torso while rotating to one side, squeezing the shoulder blade on the rotating side for a combined row and twist movement.
- Keep your feet firmly planted and generate the rotation from your thoracic spine, not your lumbar spine or hips.
- Alternate the twist direction each rep to work both sides of the upper back and obliques evenly.

## Common mistakes

- Twisting at the lower back instead of the thoracic spine, which can cause lumbar strain and reduces upper back engagement.

- Not alternating sides, which creates an imbalance between your left and right upper back.
