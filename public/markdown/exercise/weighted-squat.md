## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointing slightly outward.
2. Hold a weight in front of your chest or on your shoulders.
3. Engage your core and keep your chest up as you lower your hips down and back, as if sitting into a chair.
4. Lower until your thighs are parallel to the ground, or as low as you can comfortably go.
5. Push through your heels to stand back up, squeezing your glutes at the top.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Brace your core by taking a deep belly breath before each rep to create intra-abdominal pressure.
- Push your knees out over your toes as you descend to prevent them from caving inward.
- Drive through the full foot with slightly more emphasis on the heels to maximize glute activation.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the knees cave inward (valgus) during the ascent, which stresses the knee ligaments.
- Rising onto the toes as you squat, indicating poor ankle mobility or an overly forward lean.
- Not squatting deep enough to break parallel, which limits glute and hamstring activation.
