## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand.
2. Extend one leg forward and keep it off the ground throughout the exercise.
3. Bend your standing leg and lower your body down as if sitting back into a chair.
4. Keep your chest up and your back straight.
5. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push through your heel to return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch legs.

## Pro tips

- Extend the non-working leg forward and squat as deep as possible on the standing leg, sitting back into the heel.
- Hold the dumbbells at your sides for counterbalance and keep your chest up throughout the descent.
- Start with a box or bench behind you to sit onto until you develop the strength and balance for full-depth reps.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the knee cave inward on the working leg, which stresses the MCL and meniscus under heavy single-leg load.
- Rounding the back as you descend, which shifts load to the spine instead of the working leg.
- Not sitting back enough into the heel, which causes you to fall forward and lose balance.
