## Pro tips

- Start in a kneeling position with your hands on the ground slightly in front of your head, then extend at the elbows to push your body up.
- Keep your body straight from knees to shoulders; don't let the hips sag or pike up.
- Lower slowly by bending only at the elbows, keeping them pointed forward, not out to the sides.

## Common mistakes

- Turning this into a Pushup by bending at the shoulders instead of isolating the elbow extension.
- Placing the hands too far forward, which reduces the tricep load and increases shoulder involvement.
- Letting the elbows flare out to the sides, which shifts work to the chest and shoulders.
