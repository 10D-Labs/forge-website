## How to perform

1. Start in a high plank position with your hands directly under your shoulders and your body in a straight line.
2. Lower your chest towards the ground, keeping your elbows close to your body.
3. As you lower, squeeze your shoulder blades together and push your chest forward.
4. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push back up to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your arms completely straight; the movement comes only from your shoulder blades, not elbow bending.
- At the top, push the floor away aggressively to protract your scapulae and round your upper back.
- At the bottom, let your chest sink between your shoulder blades to achieve full retraction.

## Common mistakes

- Bending the elbows and performing a regular Pushup instead of keeping arms locked and moving only the scapulae.
- Not achieving full range of protraction and retraction, which limits serratus anterior and rhomboid activation.
- Rushing through reps. Each rep should take 3-4 seconds to move through the full scapular range.
