## How to perform

1. Lie face down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing each other.
2. Extend your arms straight down towards the floor, keeping a slight bend in your elbows.
3. Engaging your shoulder muscles, lift your arms out to the sides until they are parallel to the floor.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your arms back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lie face down on the bench with your arms hanging straight down and a slight elbow bend to set the proper starting position.
- Raise both arms simultaneously to parallel, squeezing the shoulder blades together at the top for maximum rear delt and rhomboid activation.
- Use a weight you can control for 12+ reps with good form; rear delts grow best with high-rep, controlled work.

## Common mistakes

- Bending the elbows too much during the raise, which turns the movement into a row and shifts work to the lats and biceps.
- Lifting the chest off the bench to create momentum, which defeats the isolation purpose of the prone position.
- Raising the arms past parallel to the floor, which shifts the load to the upper traps.
