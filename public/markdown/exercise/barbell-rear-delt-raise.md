## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a barbell with an overhand grip, palms facing down.
2. Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight.
3. Raise the barbell out to the sides, keeping your arms straight, until they are parallel to the ground.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hinge forward at the hips so your torso is nearly parallel to the ground, then raise the bar out to the sides with straight arms.
- Use a light weight and focus on squeezing the rear delts at the top; this is a small muscle group that doesn't need heavy loading.
- Keep a slight bend in your elbows and think about leading with the backs of your hands rather than your fists.

## Common mistakes

- Not hinging forward enough, which turns the movement into a front raise or Lateral Raise instead of targeting the rear delts.
- Using momentum by swinging the bar up rather than controlling the lift with the posterior deltoids.
- Shrugging the shoulders up toward the ears, which recruits the traps and takes work away from the rear delts.

## FAQ

### Are Barbell Rear Delt Raises effective?

They work but are less common than dumbbell or cable variations because the barbell restricts your natural arm path. Dumbbells allow a freer range of motion for rear delt isolation.

### What grip width should I use?

Slightly wider than shoulder width. Too narrow limits the range of motion; too wide makes it harder to maintain the hinge position.

### How do I know if I'm hitting my rear delts and not my traps?

Keep your shoulder blades depressed (pulled down away from your ears) throughout the movement. If your traps cramp first, you're shrugging. Reduce the weight and focus on the squeeze in the back of your shoulders.

### What muscles does the Barbell Rear Delt Raise work?

The Barbell Rear Delt Raise primarily targets the shoulders, with secondary activation in the traps, rhomboids. It's classified as a strength exercise for the shoulders.

### Is the Barbell Rear Delt Raise good for beginners?

The Barbell Rear Delt Raise is rated as intermediate. Beginners should build a base of shoulders strength with easier variations first.
