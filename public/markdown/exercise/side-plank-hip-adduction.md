## How to perform

1. Start by lying on your side with your legs extended and stacked on top of each other.
2. Prop yourself up on your forearm, keeping your elbow directly below your shoulder.
3. Engage your core and lift your hips off the ground, creating a straight line from your head to your feet.
4. While maintaining the side plank position, lift your top leg towards the ceiling, keeping it straight.
5. Slowly lower your leg back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch sides.

## Pro tips

- Place your top foot on a bench or elevated surface and lift your bottom leg upward toward it to truly isolate the adductors.
- Keep your body in a perfectly straight line from head to feet; any sagging compromises adductor activation.
- Control the lowering phase of each rep for at least 2 seconds to maximize inner thigh engagement.

## Common mistakes

- Confusing this with hip abduction by lifting the top leg instead of the bottom leg, which completely changes the target muscle.
- Allowing the hips to drop or pike, reducing the stability demand and taking tension off the adductors.
- Placing the supporting elbow too far forward or behind the shoulder, which creates shoulder strain.
