## How to perform

1. Attach the ankle cuff to your ankle and stand facing the cable machine.
2. Position yourself far enough away from the machine so that there is tension on the cable.
3. Place your hands on the machine for support.
4. Keeping your leg straight, slowly move your leg across your body towards the midline.
5. Pause for a moment at the end of the movement, then slowly return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Stand on the leg that is not working and hold the machine frame for balance. Keep the working leg straight as you sweep it across your body.
- Control the return phase slowly. The eccentric portion of hip adduction is where much of the inner thigh strengthening occurs.
- Angle your toes slightly outward on the working leg to better engage the adductor longus and magnus.

## Common mistakes

- Swinging the leg across too quickly using momentum rather than controlled adductor engagement.
- Leaning your torso away from the working leg to cheat the range of motion, which reduces inner thigh activation.
- Setting the cable attachment too high on the ankle, which can cause discomfort and reduce range of motion.
