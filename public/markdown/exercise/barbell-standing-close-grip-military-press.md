## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold the barbell with an overhand grip, hands slightly closer than shoulder-width apart.
2. Lift the barbell to shoulder height, keeping your elbows close to your body.
3. Press the barbell overhead, extending your arms fully.
4. Lower the barbell back to shoulder height.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Brace your core hard and squeeze your glutes to create a stable base and prevent your lower back from arching.
- Keep your elbows slightly in front of the bar rather than flared out to the sides to protect the shoulder joint.
- Press the bar in a slight arc around your face, then lock out directly over the crown of your head.

## Common mistakes

- Excessively arching the lower back to compensate for weak shoulders, turning the press into an incline bench.
- Gripping too narrow, which puts excessive strain on the wrists and limits the amount of weight you can press safely.
- Not fully locking out overhead, which robs you of the stability benefit and reduces time under tension for the triceps.
