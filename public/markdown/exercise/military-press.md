## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height and position yourself on the machine with your back against the backrest.
2. Grasp the handles with an overhand grip and position your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3. Push the handles upward until your arms are fully extended, but do not lock your elbows.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the handles back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Adjust the seat so the handles start at shoulder height and press straight up, finishing with full arm extension without locking the elbows hard.
- Keep your back pressed against the pad and avoid arching to use chest assistance.
- Lower the handles to the starting position under control, resisting the urge to let the weight stack drop.

## Common mistakes

- Arching the back excessively to push heavier weight, which stresses the lumbar spine.
- Not pressing through the full range of motion. Go from shoulder height to full extension for complete deltoid development.
- Setting the seat too low, which forces the starting position behind the head and strains the shoulders.
