## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Take a step forward with your right leg, lowering your body into a lunge position.
3. Keep your torso upright and your front knee aligned with your ankle.
4. Push off with your right foot and bring your left foot forward, stepping into a lunge position with your left leg.
5. Continue alternating legs and walking forward, maintaining a controlled and steady pace.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Take a long enough step that your front shin stays vertical at the bottom of the lunge; short steps push the knee too far forward.
- Drive up through the heel of your front foot to maximize glute activation as you step into the next rep.
- Keep your torso upright and avoid leaning forward, which shifts stress from the glutes to the lower back.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the front knee cave inward, which stresses the knee ligaments; actively push the knee out over the pinky toe.
- Taking short, choppy steps that turn the movement into a quad-dominant exercise and reduce glute and hamstring involvement.
- Rushing through the reps instead of pausing briefly at the bottom of each lunge to build control and balance.

Not when done correctly. Keep your front knee tracking over your toes, take long strides, and avoid slamming your back knee into the ground. If you have existing knee issues, start with shorter range of motion.
