## How to perform

1. Set up the smith machine with the barbell at hip height.
2. Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, toes pointing outwards.
3. Position yourself under the barbell, resting it on your upper back and shoulders.
4. Engage your core and keep your chest up as you lower your body down into a squat position, pushing your hips back and bending your knees.
5. Lower yourself until your thighs are parallel to the ground, or as low as you can comfortably go.
6. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push through your heels to return to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Position your feet wider than shoulder width with toes pointed out at about 45 degrees under the Smith machine bar.
- Descend by pushing your knees outward in line with your toes while keeping your torso upright.
- Drive through your heels and squeeze your glutes at the top of each rep.

## Common mistakes

- Standing too far forward or back under the bar, which creates an unnatural squatting path on the fixed Smith bar.
- Letting the knees cave inward during the descent, which strains the knee ligaments and reduces inner thigh activation.
- Not going deep enough. In a sumo squat, aim for thighs parallel to the floor or deeper for maximal glute and adductor activation.
