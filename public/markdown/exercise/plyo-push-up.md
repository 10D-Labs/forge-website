## How to perform

1. Start in a high plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
2. Lower your chest towards the ground by bending your elbows, keeping your body in a straight line.
3. Push explosively off the ground, using your chest muscles to propel your upper body off the ground.
4. Land softly with your hands back in the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Generate power from the bottom position by driving explosively through your palms and chest, not your shoulders.
- Land with soft elbows, never locked, to absorb impact and protect your joints.
- Keep your core braced throughout the entire movement so your hips do not sag during takeoff or landing.

## Common mistakes

- Not going deep enough before the explosive push, which limits power output and chest engagement.
- Landing with stiff arms, which transmits shock directly into the elbow and wrist joints.
- Letting the hips pike up or sag during the explosive phase, reducing force transfer through the chest.
