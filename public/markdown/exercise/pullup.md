## How to perform

1. Hang from a pullup bar with your palms facing away from you and your arms fully extended.
2. Engage your core and squeeze your shoulder blades together.
3. Pull your body up towards the bar by bending your elbows and bringing your chest towards the bar.
4. Pause at the top of the movement, then slowly lower your body back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Initiate the movement by depressing and retracting your shoulder blades before bending your elbows.
- Pull until your chin clears the bar, then lower yourself all the way to a dead hang on every rep.
- Keep your core tight and legs still; swinging wastes energy and reduces back muscle engagement.

## Common mistakes

- Not going through the full range of motion (partial reps from halfway up or not lowering to a dead hang).
- Kipping or swinging the legs to generate momentum, which reduces lat and bicep activation.
- Craning the neck forward to get the chin 'over' the bar without actually pulling high enough.
