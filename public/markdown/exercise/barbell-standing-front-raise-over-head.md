2. Keep your back straight and engage your core.
3. Slowly raise the barbell in front of you, keeping your arms straight and your palms facing down.
4. Continue lifting until the barbell is slightly above shoulder level.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the barbell back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Raise the bar with straight arms from your thighs all the way overhead in one controlled motion.
- Use a light weight since the lever arm is longest when the bar is at shoulder height and continues overhead.
- Lower under control with the same slow tempo to maximize shoulder time under tension.

## Common mistakes

- Using too much weight and leaning back excessively to get the bar overhead, which strains the lower back.
- Bending the elbows to shorten the lever arm and make the exercise easier, which reduces the training effect.
- Swinging the bar up using hip momentum instead of strict shoulder strength.
