## How to perform

1. Begin with a brief warm-up walk or light jog.
2. Start running at a comfortable pace, landing with a midfoot strike.
3. Keep your arms bent at 90 degrees, swinging them naturally with each stride.
4. Maintain an upright posture with your head up and shoulders relaxed.
5. Breathe rhythmically, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth.
6. Continue running for your target duration.
7. Finish with a cool-down walk and stretching.

## Pro tips

- Land with your foot under your center of mass, not in front of it, to reduce braking forces and injury risk.
- Keep your shoulders relaxed and arms swinging at 90 degrees; tension in the upper body wastes energy.
- Start slower than you think you need to; you can always speed up in the second half of your run.

## Common mistakes

- Starting too fast and burning out before completing the planned duration.
- Heel striking with an extended leg far in front of the body, which creates a braking force on every step.
- Tensing the shoulders and fists, which wastes energy and restricts breathing.
