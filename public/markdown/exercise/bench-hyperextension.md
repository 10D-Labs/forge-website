## How to perform

1. Adjust the hyperextension bench so that your hips are resting comfortably on the pad and your feet are secured.
2. Cross your arms over your chest or place your hands behind your head.
3. Slowly lower your upper body towards the ground while keeping your back straight.
4. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then raise your upper body back up until it is in line with your legs.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Position the pad at your hip crease so your upper body can hinge freely without restricting the range of motion.
- Lower until your torso is roughly 45-60 degrees below parallel, then raise until your body forms a straight line. Don't hyperextend.
- Hold a weight plate against your chest to add resistance once bodyweight becomes too easy.

## Common mistakes

- Rounding the back during the descent instead of maintaining a neutral spine and hinging at the hips.
- Swinging up too high past the point of a straight body line, which compresses the lumbar spine.
- Going too fast and using momentum rather than controlled, deliberate muscle engagement.
