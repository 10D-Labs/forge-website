## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height and foot platform to your desired position.
2. Sit on the machine with your back against the pad and your feet flat on the foot platform.
3. Grasp the handles or the sides of the seat for stability.
4. Engage your glutes and hamstrings, and push through your heels to lift the weight up.
5. Keep your back straight and avoid rounding your shoulders.
6. Extend your hips fully at the top of the movement, squeezing your glutes.
7. Lower the weight back down in a controlled manner, keeping tension on your glutes and hamstrings.
8. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Adjust the machine so you start from a position where your hips are hinged and knees slightly bent, simulating a conventional Deadlift setup.
- Drive through your whole foot and focus on pushing the ground away rather than pulling the weight up.
- Lock out by squeezing your glutes and standing tall. Don't hyperextend your back at the top.

## Common mistakes

- Rounding the back during the lift, which is the most common cause of lower back injury on Deadlifts.
- Starting with the hips too high (stiff-legged) or too low (squat-style), instead of finding the proper hip height for your proportions.
- Jerking the weight off the bottom instead of building tension gradually before pulling.
