## How to perform

1. Sit on an incline bench with a dumbbell in one hand, resting on your thigh.
2. Lean back on the bench and use your thigh to help raise the dumbbell to shoulder height.
3. Rotate your wrist so that your palm is facing inward, towards your body.
4. Press the dumbbell up and away from your body, extending your arm fully.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbell back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch arms.

## Pro tips

- Set the incline to 30-45 degrees to emphasize the upper chest and front deltoid along with the triceps.
- Use your free hand to grip the bench for stability and resist the rotational pull of the single-arm load.
- Press the dumbbell in a slight arc inward rather than straight up to get a better peak contraction.

## Common mistakes

- Setting the incline too steep, which turns the press into a shoulder exercise and reduces chest involvement.
- Rotating the torso toward the working arm instead of keeping the chest square to the ceiling.
- Bouncing the dumbbell off the shoulder at the bottom rather than pausing and pressing with control.
