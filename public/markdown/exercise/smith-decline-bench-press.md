3. Grasp the barbell with an overhand grip slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
4. Unrack the barbell and lower it slowly towards your chest, keeping your elbows tucked in.

## Pro tips

- Position the bench so the bar naturally lowers to your lower chest line.
- Keep your shoulder blades pinched and your feet secured firmly under the foot pads.

## Common mistakes

- Setting the decline angle too steep, which reduces chest activation and increases discomfort.
- Letting the bar drift toward the neck instead of targeting the lower pecs.
- Not securing the feet under the pads, which can cause you to slide on the bench during the press.
