## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Take a step forward with one foot and place it about two feet in front of the other foot.
3. Lower your body by bending your knees and hips, keeping your back straight.
4. Continue lowering until your front thigh is parallel to the ground, and your back knee is hovering just above the ground.
5. Pause for a moment, then push through your front heel to return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch legs and repeat.

## Pro tips

- Keep about 80% of your weight on the front foot and use the back foot only for balance.
- Lower straight down rather than forward; your front knee should track over your toes without drifting inward.
- Maintain an upright torso and avoid leaning forward, which shifts the load from quads to lower back.

## Common mistakes

- Placing the feet too close together, which reduces stability and limits depth.
- Letting the front knee cave inward during the descent, which puts stress on the knee ligaments.
- Pushing off the back foot to stand up, which defeats the purpose of unilateral leg training.
