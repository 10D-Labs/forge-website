## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand.
2. Take a step backward with your right foot, lowering your body into a lunge position.
3. Bend your left knee and lower your body until your left thigh is parallel to the ground.
4. Pause for a moment, then push through your left heel to return to the starting position.
5. Repeat on the other side, stepping back with your left foot.

## Pro tips

- Step straight back, not diagonally, and lower until your back knee nearly touches the floor for full glute and quad activation.
- Keep your front shin relatively vertical with the knee stacked over the ankle to protect the knee joint.
- Push through the heel of your front foot to return to standing, which emphasizes the glutes.

## Common mistakes

- Stepping back too short a distance, which forces the front knee past the toes and increases knee stress.
- Leaning the torso forward excessively during the lunge, which shifts load off the glutes and onto the lower back.
- Letting the front knee collapse inward, which stresses the MCL and meniscus.
