## How to perform

1. Lie flat on your back with your legs extended.
2. Bend one knee and bring it towards your chest, holding onto your thigh or shin.
3. Straighten your leg as much as possible while keeping it elevated.
4. Hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds.
5. Repeat with the other leg.

## Pro tips

- Keep your opposite leg flat on the ground with the knee straight to stabilize your pelvis.
- Pull gently and hold at the point of stretch, not pain; you should feel a strong pull but no sharp discomfort.
- Flex your foot on the elevated leg to add a calf stretch and increase the hamstring lengthening.

## Common mistakes

- Lifting the head and shoulders off the ground, which shortens the hamstring chain and reduces the stretch.
- Bending the knee of the elevated leg too much, which defeats the purpose of the stretch.
- Allowing the opposite leg to lift off the ground, which tilts the pelvis and reduces hamstring isolation.
