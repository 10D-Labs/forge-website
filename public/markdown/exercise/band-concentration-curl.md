## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench or chair with your legs spread apart and your feet flat on the ground.
2. Hold one end of the band in your hand and step on the other end with your foot on the same side.
3. Lean forward slightly and rest your elbow on the inside of your thigh, just above the knee.
4. With your palm facing up, slowly curl your hand towards your shoulder, keeping your upper arm stationary.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your hand back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch sides.

## Pro tips

- Brace your elbow firmly against the inside of your thigh to eliminate any arm swing or body momentum.
- Curl the band slowly and squeeze the bicep at the top for a 2-second hold before lowering.
- Adjust your foot position on the band to increase or decrease resistance.

## Common mistakes

- Lifting the elbow off the thigh during the curl, which allows the shoulder to assist and reduces bicep isolation.
- Using a band that is too heavy, causing you to lean your torso to cheat the weight up.
- Not fully extending the arm at the bottom, which limits the stretch and range of motion.

## FAQ

### Why is the concentration curl considered the best bicep isolation exercise?

The braced elbow position eliminates shoulder and back involvement, forcing the bicep to do 100% of the work. EMG studies show it produces very high bicep activation.

### Can you get the same effect with a band as with a dumbbell?

The muscle activation is similar, but the resistance curve is different. Bands are hardest at the top (peak contraction) while dumbbells are hardest at mid-range.

### How many reps should you do for Band Concentration Curls?

12-20 reps per arm with a focus on slow, controlled movement and peak contraction. This is an isolation exercise, not a strength exercise.

### What muscles does the Band Concentration Curl work?

The Band Concentration Curl primarily targets the biceps, with secondary activation in the forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.

### Is the Band Concentration Curl good for beginners?

Yes, the Band Concentration Curl is rated as a beginner-level exercise. It's a great starting point for building biceps strength.
