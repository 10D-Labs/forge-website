## How to perform

1. Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold the ez barbell with an underhand grip, palms facing up.
2. Keep your elbows close to your torso and your upper arms stationary throughout the movement.
3. Exhale as you curl the barbell up towards your shoulders, contracting your biceps.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then inhale as you slowly lower the barbell back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use the outer angled grips for a more natural wrist position that reduces strain compared to a straight barbell.
- Keep your elbows pinned at your sides throughout the entire range of motion to isolate the biceps.
- Lower the bar under control for a full 2-3 second eccentric to maximize muscle fiber recruitment.

## Common mistakes

- Rocking the body back at the bottom of the rep to generate momentum instead of curling with strict form.
- Cutting the range of motion short by not fully extending at the bottom or not curling all the way to shoulder height.
- Flaring the elbows forward as the weight gets heavy, which shifts the work to the front deltoids.
