## How to perform

2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing forward and arms fully extended.
3. Keeping your elbows close to your sides, curl the dumbbells up towards your shoulders.
4. Once your forearms are vertical, rotate your wrists so that your palms are facing forward.
5. Press the dumbbells overhead until your arms are fully extended.
6. Lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position by reversing the movement.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Curl the dumbbells with a supinated grip, rotate your palms forward at the top, and press in one smooth sequence.
- Keep your elbows pinned to your sides during the curl portion; don't let them drift forward.
- Lower the weight in reverse order: bring the dumbbells to your shoulders, rotate palms inward, then lower with control.

## Common mistakes

- Using momentum from the curl to cheat the press, swinging the weights up instead of performing each phase cleanly.
- Skipping the wrist rotation between the curl and press phases, which reduces shoulder activation.
- Arching the back during the overhead press portion instead of bracing the core and pressing strictly.
