## How to perform

1. Lie flat on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground.
2. Place your hands behind your head with your elbows pointing outwards.
3. Engaging your abs, slowly lift your upper body off the ground, curling forward until your torso is at a 45 degree angle.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your upper body back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Press your lower back into the floor before initiating the curl to pre-engage your abs and protect your spine.
- Exhale forcefully as you curl up to 45 degrees, imagining you're bringing your ribcage toward your pelvis rather than lifting your head.
- Keep your elbows wide and avoid pulling on your neck; your hands are just resting behind your head for support.

## Common mistakes

- Yanking the neck forward with the hands, which strains the cervical spine and takes tension off the abs.
- Using momentum to swing up rather than controlling the movement with a slow, deliberate curl.
- Going too high past 45 degrees, which shifts the load from the abs to the hip flexors.
