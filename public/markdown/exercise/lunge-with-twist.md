## How to perform

1. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Take a step forward with your right foot, lowering your body into a lunge position.
3. As you lunge, twist your torso to the right, bringing your left elbow towards your right knee.
4. Pause for a moment, then return to the starting position.
5. Repeat on the other side, stepping forward with your left foot and twisting your torso to the left.
6. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Complete the lunge first, then add the twist once you're stable in the bottom position.
- Twist toward the front leg side, driving the rotation from the obliques and thoracic spine.
- Keep your front knee stable and tracking over your toes while you rotate; don't let it cave inward.

## Common mistakes

- Twisting before the lunge is stable, which throws off balance and reduces core engagement.
- Rotating from the lower back instead of the mid-back, which can cause lumbar strain.
- Taking too short a step, which causes the knee to push past the toes and limits the depth of the lunge.
