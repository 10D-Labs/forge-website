## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and place the band under your feet, holding the ends with your hands.
2. Keep your arms straight and relaxed, and let the band hang in front of your thighs.
3. Engage your traps by shrugging your shoulders upward, lifting the band as high as possible.
4. Hold the contraction for a moment, then slowly lower your shoulders back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Stand on the band and shrug your shoulders straight up toward your ears, not rolling them forward or backward.
- Hold the top position for 2 seconds to maximize upper trap contraction.
- Keep your arms completely straight and let the traps do all the lifting.

## Common mistakes

- Rolling the shoulders in circles, which does not increase trap activation and can stress the shoulder joint.
- Bending the elbows to assist the shrug, which recruits the biceps and reduces trap isolation.
- Not holding the top position long enough, rushing through reps with no peak contraction.
