## How to perform

2. Bend your knees slightly and hinge at the hips, lowering the kettlebell between your legs.
3. Explosively extend your hips, knees, and ankles, using the momentum to swing the kettlebell up to shoulder height.
4. As the kettlebell reaches shoulder height, rotate your wrist and punch your hand straight up, locking out your arm overhead.
5. Lower the kettlebell back down to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- The clean and jerk is two distinct movements: first clean the bell to the rack, then use a dip-and-drive to jerk it overhead.
- During the jerk, dip your knees quickly (4-6 inches), then explode upward while simultaneously punching the bell overhead.
- Lock out the overhead position with your bicep near your ear and your wrist straight before lowering.

## Common mistakes

- Trying to strict press the weight overhead after the clean instead of using the leg dip to generate upward momentum.
- Not fully completing the clean before initiating the jerk, blending the two movements into a sloppy single motion.
- Hyperextending the lower back at lockout instead of squeezing the glutes and bracing the core.
