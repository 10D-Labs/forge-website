4. Pause for a moment at the top of the movement, then slowly lower The back down by bending your knees and ankles.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Place only the balls of your feet on the very bottom edge of the sled and let your heels hang off completely.
- Press through the balls of your feet to extend your ankles fully, holding the top contraction for 1-2 seconds.
- Use a full range of motion by letting your toes come back toward your shins as far as comfortable before pressing again.

## Common mistakes

- Placing too much of the foot on the sled, which prevents a full ankle extension and limits calf activation.
- Bending the knees during the press movement, which turns it into a partial Leg Press instead of a calf isolation exercise.
- Using excessive weight that forces a bouncing motion rather than controlled contractions.
