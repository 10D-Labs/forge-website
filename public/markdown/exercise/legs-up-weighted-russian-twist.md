## How to perform

1. Sit on the ground with your knees bent and feet lifted off the ground, keeping your legs together.
2. Hold the weight with both hands in front of your chest, keeping your elbows slightly bent.
3. Lean back slightly to engage your core muscles.
4. Twist your torso to the right, bringing the weight towards the ground on your right side.
5. Pause for a moment, then twist your torso to the left, bringing the weight towards the ground on your left side.
6. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lift your feet off the ground and keep your shins roughly parallel to the floor to maximally engage the lower abs.
- Rotate from the ribcage, not just the arms, to ensure the obliques do the work.
- Tap the weight gently to the floor on each side rather than slamming it down.

## Common mistakes

- Moving only the arms side to side without actually rotating the torso, which bypasses the obliques entirely.
- Letting the feet drift down toward the floor as the set progresses, reducing core engagement.
- Rounding the lower back excessively, which puts pressure on the lumbar spine under load.
