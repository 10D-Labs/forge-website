## How to perform

1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor.
2. Place your hands behind your head or cross them over your chest.
3. Engage your abs and lift your shoulder blades off the floor, rotating your torso to one side.
4. Pause for a moment, then lower your shoulder blades back down to the floor.
5. Repeat on the other side, alternating sides with each repetition.

## Pro tips

- Rotate your torso by driving your shoulder toward the opposite knee, not by moving your elbow forward.
- Keep your lower back pressed into the floor throughout the movement to prevent hip flexor dominance.
- Exhale as you rotate and crunch up to fully engage the obliques.

## Common mistakes

- Moving the elbow forward toward the knee rather than rotating the torso, which only creates the illusion of rotation.
- Using momentum to swing from side to side rather than controlled, deliberate oblique contractions.
- Lifting with the neck and head instead of initiating the movement from the core.

## FAQ

### Do oblique crunches make your waist wider?

No. Oblique crunches build definition and strength in the side muscles of the core. Significant oblique hypertrophy from bodyweight crunches alone is extremely unlikely.

### How many oblique crunches should I do per side?

Aim for 12-20 reps per side for 2-3 sets. Focus on quality of contraction rather than just hitting a number.

### Should I alternate sides or do all reps on one side first?

Both approaches work. Alternating sides is more common and maintains balance during the set, but doing all reps on one side first can create a stronger mind-muscle connection.
