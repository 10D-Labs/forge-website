## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing your body.
2. Keep your back straight and engage your core.
3. Raise your arms out to the sides, keeping a slight bend in your elbows, until they are parallel to the ground.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your arms back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Raise the dumbbells at a 30-degree angle in front of your body (between a front raise and a Lateral Raise), with your thumbs pointing upward like you are pouring a can upward.
- The full can position (thumbs up) is safer for the shoulder than the empty can position (thumbs down) because it reduces subacromial impingement.
- Raise to shoulder height and pause for one second before lowering with control.

## Common mistakes

- Raising directly to the side like a standard Lateral Raise instead of at a 30-degree forward angle, which changes the target muscles.
- Using the empty can position (thumbs down), which increases shoulder impingement risk significantly.
- Shrugging the shoulders during the raise, which recruits the upper traps instead of the supraspinatus and deltoid.
