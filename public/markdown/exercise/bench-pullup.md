3. Hang with your arms fully extended and your body straight.
4. Pull your chest towards the bar or surface by squeezing your shoulder blades together and bending your elbows.
5. Continue pulling until your chin is above the bar or surface.
6. Lower yourself back down to the starting position with control.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Grab the bar or surface with a slightly wider than shoulder-width overhand grip for optimal lat engagement.
- Keep your core tight and body in a straight line from head to heels as you pull your chest to the bar.
- Use a bench or bar set at chest height to make this a progression toward full Pullups.

## Common mistakes

- Kipping or swinging the body to gain momentum instead of pulling with a controlled, strict motion.
- Not pulling high enough, stopping when the chin is still below the bar rather than getting the chest to bar level.
- Allowing the hips to drop or sag, which disengages the core and reduces the pulling demand.
