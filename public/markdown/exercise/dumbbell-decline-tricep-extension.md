## How to perform

1. Lie on a decline bench with your head lower than your feet and hold a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing each other.
2. Extend your arms fully, keeping your elbows close to your head.
3. Lower the dumbbells slowly behind your head, bending your elbows.
4. Pause for a moment, then raise the dumbbells back to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lie on a decline bench with dumbbells extended above your chest, palms facing each other. Lower the dumbbells by bending only at the elbows toward the sides of your head.
- Keep your upper arms vertical and stationary throughout. Only your forearms should move, hinging at the elbows.
- The decline angle increases the stretch on the long head of the triceps at the bottom position, making this more effective than flat skull crushers for that muscle.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the upper arms drift backward (toward your face) as you lower the weight, which reduces the Tricep Stretch and engagement.
- Using dumbbells that are too heavy, which causes the elbows to flare out and the shoulders to assist.
- Lowering the dumbbells too quickly near the head without control, which is dangerous.
