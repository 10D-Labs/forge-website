## How to perform

2. Bend one knee and place your foot flat on the ground.
3. Using your hands or a towel, gently pull your toes towards your body, feeling a stretch in your calf.
4. Hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds.
5. Release the stretch and repeat on the other leg.

## Pro tips

- Use a towel or strap around the ball of your foot to pull your toes toward your shin for a deeper calf stretch.
- Keep the stretching leg as straight as possible to target both the gastrocnemius and the soleus.
- Breathe deeply and hold for at least 20 seconds; calves are dense muscles that need sustained stretching.

## Common mistakes

- Bending the knee of the stretching leg, which reduces the gastrocnemius stretch.
- Pulling too aggressively, which can cause a calf cramp or strain.
- Holding for too short a duration; calves need at least 20-30 seconds of sustained hold to effectively lengthen.
