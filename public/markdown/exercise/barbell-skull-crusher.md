## How to perform

1. Lie flat on a bench with your feet flat on the ground and your head at the end of the bench.
2. Hold the barbell with an overhand grip, hands shoulder-width apart, and extend your arms straight up over your chest.
3. Keeping your upper arms stationary, slowly lower the barbell towards your forehead by bending your elbows.
4. Pause for a moment when the barbell is just above your forehead, then extend your arms back up to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Angle your upper arms slightly back toward your head (not straight up) so there's tension on the triceps even at the top of the rep.
- Lower the bar to your forehead or just behind it with a controlled 2-3 second eccentric.
- Keep your elbows shoulder-width apart; don't let them flare out or squeeze together.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the elbows flare wide, which shifts stress to the shoulders and increases elbow joint strain.
- Holding the upper arms perpendicular to the floor, which creates a dead spot at the top where the triceps aren't working.
- Using too much weight and turning the exercise into a close-grip press by involving the chest and shoulders.

## FAQ

### Why are they called skull crushers?

Because the bar is lowered toward the forehead (skull). Despite the intimidating name, they're perfectly safe when performed with controlled weight and proper form.

### Should I lower the bar to my forehead or behind my head?

Behind the head (toward the bench) gives a deeper stretch on the long head of the triceps. To the forehead is the standard version. Both are effective; behind the head is slightly more demanding.

### Do skull crushers hurt your elbows?

They can if you use too much weight or lock out aggressively. Use moderate weight, control every rep, and try an EZ curl bar if straight bar causes elbow pain. Stop if you feel sharp pain.

The Barbell Skull Crusher primarily targets the triceps, with secondary activation in the shoulders. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.
