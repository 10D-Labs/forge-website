## How to perform

1. Stand on a raised platform with your toes on the edge and your heels hanging off.
2. Hold onto a stable object for support.
3. Raise your heels as high as possible by extending your ankles.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your heels back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Pause for 2-3 seconds at the top of each rep with a full calf contraction to maximize the peak squeeze.
- Lower your heels below the platform for a full stretch at the bottom before driving back up.
- Keep your knees slightly bent throughout to emphasize the gastrocnemius over the soleus.

## Common mistakes

- Bouncing at the bottom of the rep using momentum rather than controlling the stretch and contraction.
- Not using a full range of motion by failing to drop the heels below the platform level.
- Bending too much at the hips, which reduces calf activation and turns it into a lower back exercise.
