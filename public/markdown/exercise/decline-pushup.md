## How to perform

1. Place your hands on an elevated surface, such as a bench or step, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
2. Extend your legs behind you, resting on the balls of your feet, creating a straight line from your head to your heels.
3. Lower your chest towards the elevated surface by bending your elbows, keeping your body in a straight line.
4. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push yourself back up to the starting position by straightening your arms.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Elevate your feet 12-18 inches on a bench or step to shift more load onto the upper chest and anterior deltoids.
- Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels. Don't let your hips pike up or sag down.
- Lower your chest to the floor with elbows at a 45-degree angle from your body for optimal shoulder health.

## Common mistakes

- Piking the hips up high, which turns the Decline Pushup into a pseudo-pike Pushup and reduces chest engagement.
- Placing the hands too far forward (ahead of the shoulders) rather than directly under the shoulders.
- Not going through a full range of motion by stopping several inches above the floor.
