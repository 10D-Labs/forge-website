## How to perform

1. Adjust the cable pulley to a high position and attach a straight bar.
2. Sit facing the cable machine with your feet flat on the ground and your knees slightly bent.
3. Grasp the bar with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
4. Lean back slightly and keep your chest up, maintaining a slight arch in your lower back.
5. Pull the bar down towards your chest, leading with your elbows and squeezing your shoulder blades together.
6. Pause for a moment at the bottom of the movement, then slowly return the bar to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Depress your shoulder blades down and back before initiating the pull. This engages the lats from the very start of the rep.
- Pull the bar to your upper chest, not behind your neck. Behind-the-neck pulldowns place the shoulder in a vulnerable position.
- Lean back about 15-20 degrees and puff your chest up to create a better line of pull for the lats.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning too far back and turning the pulldown into a cable row, which shifts emphasis from the lats to the mid-back.
- Pulling with the biceps by not engaging the shoulder blades first. If your forearms burn out before your lats, this is the issue.
- Using too wide a grip, which reduces range of motion and can strain the shoulders.
