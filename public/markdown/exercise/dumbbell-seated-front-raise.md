## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with your feet flat on the ground and a dumbbell in each hand, resting on your thighs.
2. Keep your back straight and core engaged.
3. Raise the dumbbells in front of you, with your palms facing down, until they are at shoulder level.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Raise both dumbbells in front of you to shoulder height with palms facing down, keeping your arms straight throughout.
- Sit tall with your back against the bench and resist the urge to lean back as the dumbbells get heavier at shoulder height.
- Lower the dumbbells slowly over 2 seconds to keep constant tension on the anterior delts.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning back against the bench and arching to assist the raise, which uses momentum instead of front delt strength.
- Raising the dumbbells above shoulder height, which recruits the traps and takes tension off the front delts.
- Using too much weight and swinging the arms up rather than raising them with controlled deltoid contraction.
