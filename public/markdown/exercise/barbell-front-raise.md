## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a barbell in front of your thighs with an overhand grip.
2. Keep your arms straight and lift the barbell forward and upward until it reaches shoulder level.
3. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the barbell back down to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Raise the bar with your arms straight but elbows slightly soft (not locked) to protect the elbow joint.
- Stop at shoulder height; going higher shifts the work to your traps rather than your front delts.
- Use a controlled 2-second lift and 2-second lower to maximize anterior deltoid time under tension.

## Common mistakes

- Using momentum by swinging the hips and leaning back to heave the bar up.
- Raising the bar too high above shoulder level, which recruits the traps and reduces front delt isolation.
- Gripping too wide, which turns it into more of a Lateral Raise and reduces the front delt emphasis.

## FAQ
