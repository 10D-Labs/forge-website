4. Hold the stretch for 15-30 seconds.
5. Return to the starting position and repeat on the other side.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Reach your top arm overhead and actively pull toward the side you're stretching to for a deeper lat stretch.
- Keep your hips level and don't shift them to the opposite side, which reduces the stretch.
- Hold the stretched position for 20-30 seconds and breathe into the ribcage on the stretched side.

## Common mistakes

- Twisting the torso forward or backward instead of stretching directly to the side.
- Pushing the hips out to the opposite side instead of keeping them centered, which reduces the stretch on the lats.
- Holding for too short a duration to achieve meaningful tissue lengthening.
