3. Lower your chest towards the ground by bending your elbows, keeping them close to your sides.
4. Push through your palms to extend your arms and return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

- Place your hands roughly 1.5 times shoulder width apart with fingers angled slightly outward for a natural wrist position.
