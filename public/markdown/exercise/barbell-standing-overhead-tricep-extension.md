## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a barbell with an overhand grip.
2. Raise the barbell overhead, fully extending your arms.
3. Keeping your upper arms close to your head, slowly lower the barbell behind your head by bending your elbows.
4. Pause for a moment, then raise the barbell back to the starting position by extending your arms.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your upper arms vertical and close to your ears; only your forearms should move during the extension.
- Lower the bar behind your head until you feel a deep stretch in the long head of the triceps, then extend powerfully.
- Brace your core to prevent arching your lower back, especially as the set gets harder.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the elbows flare out wide, which reduces the stretch on the long head and increases shoulder strain.
- Arching the lower back to compensate for heavy weight overhead, which puts the lumbar spine at risk.
- Not lowering the bar deep enough behind the head to get a full Tricep Stretch.

## FAQ

### Standing vs seated overhead Tricep Extension: which is better?

Both are effective. Standing engages the core more and allows slightly more freedom of movement. Seated provides back support and lets you focus purely on the triceps. Choose based on your goals.

### How much weight should I use?

Start with about 40-50% of your close grip bench press weight. The overhead position with a long lever arm makes this exercise challenging with relatively light loads.

### Can this exercise cause shoulder problems?

It can aggravate existing shoulder issues due to the overhead position and deep stretch behind the head. If you have shoulder impingement, use pushdowns instead until the issue is resolved.

The Barbell Standing Overhead Tricep Extension primarily targets the triceps, with secondary activation in the shoulders. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.
