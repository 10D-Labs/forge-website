## How to perform

1. Stand in front of a bench or step with a barbell resting on your upper back.
2. Place one foot on the bench or step, ensuring your entire foot is in contact with the surface.
3. Push through your heel and step up onto the bench or step, fully extending your hip and knee.
4. Pause briefly at the top, then lower yourself back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat with the opposite leg.
6. Continue alternating legs for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Drive entirely through the foot on the box or bench; don't push off with the back foot on the ground.
- Choose a box height where your thigh is parallel to the ground when your foot is on top.
- Stand fully tall at the top of each rep, squeezing the glute of the working leg before lowering.

## Common mistakes

- Pushing off the ground with the trailing foot instead of using the front leg exclusively, which cheats the movement.
- Leaning the torso forward excessively with the bar on your back, shifting the load to the lower back.
- Choosing a box that's too high, causing the knee to shoot past the toes and compromising form.

## FAQ

### What height should the bench be for Barbell Stepups?

Your thigh should be roughly parallel to the ground when your foot is on the surface. This is typically 12-20 inches depending on your height. Lower is safer for learning the movement.

### Are Barbell Stepups better than lunges?

The Barbell Stepup primarily targets the glutes, with secondary activation in the quadriceps, hamstrings, calves. It's classified as a strength exercise for the legs.
