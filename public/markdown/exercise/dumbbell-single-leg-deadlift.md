## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet hip-width apart, holding a dumbbell in your right hand.
2. Shift your weight onto your left leg and lift your right foot slightly off the ground.
3. Keeping your back straight, hinge forward at the hips and lower the dumbbell towards the ground.
4. At the same time, extend your right leg straight behind you, maintaining a slight bend in your left knee.
5. Lower the dumbbell until your torso and right leg are parallel to the ground.
6. Pause for a moment, then engage your glutes and hamstrings to return to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch sides.

## Pro tips

- Hold the dumbbell in the opposite hand from your standing leg to create a natural cross-body balance.
- Hinge at the hip while keeping a soft bend in the standing knee; don't lock it out.
- Think of your body as a seesaw: as the dumbbell lowers, your back leg rises to the same height.

## Common mistakes

- Holding the dumbbell on the same side as the standing leg, which reduces the cross-body stabilization benefit.
- Opening the hip of the trailing leg instead of keeping it pointed toward the floor.
- Rushing through the movement instead of controlling both the descent and ascent for 2-3 seconds each.
