## How to perform

1. Lie on a decline bench with your head lower than your feet and hold a barbell with a close grip.
2. Lower the barbell towards your forehead by bending your elbows, keeping your upper arms stationary.
3. Pause for a moment, then extend your arms to press the barbell back up to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lower the bar to your forehead or just behind it, keeping your upper arms angled slightly back to maintain constant tricep tension.
- Use a decline angle of 15-20 degrees to increase the stretch on the long head of the triceps at the bottom of each rep.
- Keep your wrists straight and elbows shoulder-width apart throughout the entire movement.

## Common mistakes

- Flaring the elbows wide, which shifts the load to the chest and shoulders and increases elbow joint stress.
- Lowering the bar to the nose or chin instead of the forehead, which shortens the range of motion.
- Using too much weight and losing control of the bar near the face, which is dangerous on a decline angle.
