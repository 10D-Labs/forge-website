## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, toes pointing outwards.
2. Hold a kettlebell with both hands in front of your body, arms extended downwards.
3. Bend your knees and lower your hips into a squat position, keeping your back straight.
4. Drive through your heels and explosively extend your hips and knees, pulling the kettlebell up towards your chin.
5. As you pull the kettlebell up, keep your elbows high and wide, and squeeze your shoulder blades together.
6. Lower the kettlebell back down to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Start with a wide sumo stance (toes out 45 degrees) and the kettlebell between your feet on the floor.
- Drive through your heels and extend your hips explosively, pulling the bell up with high elbows until it reaches chin height.
- Lead with the elbows, not the hands. Your elbows should always be higher than your wrists during the pull.

## Common mistakes

- Using the arms to pull before the hips have fully extended, which robs the movement of power and overloads the shoulders.
- Pulling the kettlebell too high and shrugging the shoulders up to the ears, which can cause shoulder impingement.
- Rounding the lower back during the initial pull off the floor because the sumo stance isn't wide enough.
