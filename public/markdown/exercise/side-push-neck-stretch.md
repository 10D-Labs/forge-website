## How to perform

- Tilt your head directly to the side, not forward or backward, to target the lateral neck muscles.

- Pushing the head too aggressively with the hand, which can strain the neck muscles or compress the cervical spine.
- Elevating the opposite shoulder, which reduces the stretch and can cause the stretching side to cramp.
- Holding the stretch for too short a duration to produce meaningful flexibility gains.
