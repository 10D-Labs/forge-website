## Pro tips

- Rest your forearm flat on the bench with your wrist and hand hanging off the edge, palm facing down.
- Curl the wrist upward (extend it) against gravity, squeezing the forearm extensors at the top.
- Use a very light dumbbell (3-10 pounds) since the wrist extensors are small muscles that fatigue quickly.

## Common mistakes

- Using too much weight, which causes the forearm to lift off the bench and reduces isolation.
- Moving the entire forearm instead of isolating the wrist extension movement.
- Rushing through reps without holding the top contraction, missing the peak engagement of the wrist extensors.
