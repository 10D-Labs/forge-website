## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointing forward.
2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing your body, arms extended downwards.
3. Bend at your hips and knees, lowering the dumbbells towards the ground while keeping your back straight.
4. Push through your heels and extend your hips and knees, lifting the dumbbells back up to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Stand with dumbbells at your sides, palms facing in. Hinge at the hips and lower the dumbbells along your shins, keeping your back flat and chest up.
- Drive through your heels and squeeze your glutes at the top to fully extend your hips. Your shoulders, hips, and ankles should form a straight vertical line at lockout.
- Keep the dumbbells close to your body throughout the lift. If they drift forward, it increases lower back stress.

## Common mistakes

- Rounding the lower back during the lift, which is the most common and most dangerous Deadlift error.
- Squatting the movement instead of hinging, bending the knees too much and not pushing the hips back enough.
- Looking up at the ceiling, which hyperextends the neck. Keep your neck neutral by looking at a spot on the floor a few feet ahead.
