## Pro tips

- Keep both shoulders pinned flat to the floor as your legs rotate to each side for maximum spinal rotation stretch.
- Move slowly and breathe out as your legs lower to the side to help relax the muscles being stretched.
- Aim to get your feet close to the floor on each side, but do not force it beyond a comfortable stretch.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the opposite shoulder lift off the ground, which reduces the rotational stretch through the spine.
- Swinging the legs from side to side with momentum instead of using controlled movement.
- Holding the breath during the stretch, which increases muscle tension and limits the stretch depth.
