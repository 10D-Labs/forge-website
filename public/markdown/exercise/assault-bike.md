## How to perform

1. Position yourself on the assault bike with feet on the pedals and hands gripping the handles.
2. Start pedaling while simultaneously pushing and pulling the handles.
3. Maintain a steady pace or perform intervals for high-intensity training.
4. Increase resistance or speed to vary intensity.
5. Continue for your target duration.

## Pro tips

- Drive with both your legs and arms simultaneously for maximum calorie burn; do not let your arms go passive.
- Keep your core braced and avoid excessive rocking of the torso, which wastes energy.
- For intervals, go all-out for 10-20 seconds and recover for 40-50 seconds to build anaerobic capacity.

## Common mistakes

- Relying mostly on the legs and letting the arms just hold the handles, which leaves significant upper body calorie burn on the table.
- Sitting too far forward or back on the seat, which changes the leg mechanics and reduces power output.
- Starting intervals at maximum intensity without a 3-5 minute warm-up, which increases injury risk and reduces total work output.
