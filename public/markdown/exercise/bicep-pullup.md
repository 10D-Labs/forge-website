## How to perform

1. Hang from a pullup bar with your palms facing away from you and your hands shoulder-width apart.
2. Engage your core and pull yourself up by bending your elbows, bringing your chest towards the bar.
3. Pause at the top of the movement, then slowly lower yourself back down to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Though the name says 'bicep,' the overhand grip (palms away) actually involves the brachialis and brachioradialis more than a Chinup grip.
- Pull your elbows down and to your sides, focusing on the bicep contraction rather than using back muscles to lift.
- Use a shoulder-width grip to maintain bicep emphasis while allowing a full range of motion.

## Common mistakes

- Using too wide a grip, which shifts the emphasis entirely to the lats and away from the biceps.
- Kicking the legs or swinging to generate upward momentum.
- Not fully extending the arms at the bottom, reducing the stretch on the biceps and brachialis.

## FAQ

### How is this different from a regular Pullup?

The focus is on using the biceps to pull rather than the lats. Practically, a shoulder-width overhand Pullup will always involve both, but cueing the biceps and using a moderate grip width shifts more emphasis to the arms.

### Are overhand or underhand grip Pullups better for biceps?

Underhand (Chinup) grip puts the biceps in a stronger mechanical position and produces higher bicep activation. If pure bicep development is the goal, Chinups are superior.

### How many Pullups should I aim for?

If you can do 3 sets of 8-10 Pullups with good form, that's a solid level of pulling strength. Add weight via a belt or vest when you can consistently hit 12+ reps.

### What muscles does the Bicep Pullup work?

The Bicep Pullup primarily targets the biceps, with secondary activation in the forearms, shoulders. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.

### Is the Bicep Pullup good for beginners?

The Bicep Pullup is an advanced exercise. Beginners should master fundamental arms movements first.
