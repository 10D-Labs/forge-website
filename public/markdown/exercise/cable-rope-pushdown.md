## How to perform

1. Attach a rope attachment to a high pulley on a cable machine.
2. Stand facing the machine with your feet shoulder-width apart and a slight bend in your knees.
3. Grasp the rope with an overhand grip, palms facing each other.
4. Keep your elbows close to your sides and your upper arms stationary throughout the exercise.
5. Exhale and push the rope downward by extending your elbows until your arms are fully extended.
6. Pause for a moment, then inhale and slowly return to the starting position by allowing your elbows to flex.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- At the bottom of the movement, spread the rope ends apart and rotate your wrists outward to fully contract the lateral and medial heads of the triceps.
- Keep your elbows pinned at your sides. If your elbows drift forward, the exercise becomes a Pullover and the triceps lose tension.
- Stand with a slight forward lean and staggered stance for stability, keeping your core braced.

## Common mistakes

- Flaring the elbows out to the sides or letting them drift forward, which recruits the chest and shoulders and takes tension off the triceps.
- Using body weight to push the rope down by leaning into it rather than extending the elbows with tricep strength.
- Not spreading the rope at the bottom, which misses the full lockout contraction where the triceps work hardest.

## FAQ

### Rope pushdown vs bar pushdown: what is the difference?

The rope allows you to spread the ends at the bottom for a more complete tricep contraction and greater range of motion. A straight bar limits rotation but typically allows heavier loads.

### Why do my elbows hurt during Cable Rope Pushdowns?

Elbow pain usually comes from using too much weight, locking out aggressively, or flaring the elbows. Reduce the weight, keep elbows pinned, and stop just short of full lockout if pain persists.

### What muscles does the Cable Rope Pushdown work?

The Cable Rope Pushdown primarily targets the triceps, with secondary activation in the forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.

### Is the Cable Rope Pushdown good for beginners?

Yes, the Cable Rope Pushdown is rated as a beginner-level exercise. It's a great starting point for building triceps strength.
