## How to perform

1. Hang from a pullup bar with your arms fully extended and your palms facing away from you.
2. Engage your core and lift your legs up in front of you, keeping them straight.
3. Continue lifting until your legs are parallel to the ground or as high as you can comfortably go.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Control the descent just as much as the ascent. A slow 2-3 second lowering phase doubles the effectiveness.
- Think about pulling your belt buckle toward your chin rather than just raising your feet to emphasize Pelvic Tilt.
- If you struggle with swinging, have a partner lightly touch your lower back to give you a reference point.

## Common mistakes

- Kipping or swinging to gain momentum, which takes the stress off the abs entirely.
- Stopping leg elevation when the legs reach parallel without completing the pelvic curl for full ab activation.
- Rushing through reps with no pause at the top, losing the peak contraction opportunity.
