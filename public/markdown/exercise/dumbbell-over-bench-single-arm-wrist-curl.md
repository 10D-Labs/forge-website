## How to perform

2. Rest your forearm on the bench with your wrist hanging off the edge.
3. Slowly curl your wrist upwards, bringing the dumbbell towards your forearm.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbell back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch to the other arm.

## Pro tips

- Position your forearm on the bench with your palm facing down and wrist hanging off the edge for a full range reverse curl.
- Curl the wrist upward slowly, focusing on the contraction of the extensor muscles along the top of your forearm.
- Use very light weight (3-10 lbs) since the wrist extensors are significantly weaker than the flexors.

## Common mistakes

- Using the same weight as palms-up wrist curls, which is too heavy for the wrist extensors and causes poor form.
- Moving too quickly and using momentum instead of a slow, controlled wrist curl motion.
- Allowing the forearm to rock on the bench instead of staying firmly planted.
