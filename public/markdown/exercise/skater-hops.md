## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Bend your knees slightly and jump to the right, landing on your right foot.
3. As you land, swing your left leg behind your right leg and tap the ground with your left toes.
4. Immediately jump to the left, landing on your left foot.
5. As you land, swing your right leg behind your left leg and tap the ground with your right toes.
6. Continue alternating sides, jumping and tapping the ground with each leg.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Land softly on the ball of your foot and immediately sink into a slight Single Leg Squat to absorb impact.
- Swing your arms across your body in rhythm with each hop to generate momentum and improve balance.
- Push off laterally, not upward. The goal is distance side to side, not height.

## Common mistakes

- Landing with a stiff, locked-out knee, which increases impact on the joint and reduces power for the next hop.
- Not reaching the trailing leg far enough behind, which limits the stretch on the glutes and reduces the exercise's effectiveness.
- Hopping too quickly and sacrificing the single-leg landing stability, turning it into shuffling rather than skating.
