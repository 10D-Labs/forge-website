## How to perform

1. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and your toes slightly turned out.
2. Hold the barbell behind your legs, resting it on your upper thighs.
3. Lower your body by bending at the knees and hips, keeping your back straight and your chest up.
4. Continue lowering until your thighs are parallel to the ground, or as low as you can comfortably go.
5. Pause for a moment, then push through your heels to return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hold the bar behind your legs (not in front) and keep it close to the back of your thighs and calves throughout the movement.
- Maintain an upright torso by keeping your chest up and looking straight ahead.
- Use a shoulder-width stance with toes pointed slightly out to allow proper depth and balance.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the bar drift away from the body, which shifts the load to the lower back.
- Rounding the shoulders forward because the behind-the-body bar position is unfamiliar.
- Not going deep enough due to the unusual bar position; use lighter weight until you can hit at least parallel.

## FAQ

### What's the difference between a Barbell Hack Squat and a Hack Squat machine?
