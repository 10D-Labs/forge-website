## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with your feet flat on the ground and hold a dumbbell in each hand.
2. Bend your knees slightly and lean forward from your hips, keeping your back straight.
3. Bring your upper arms close to your sides and keep your elbows bent at a 90 degree angle.
4. Extend your arms straight back, squeezing your triceps at the top of the movement.
5. Pause for a moment, then slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lean forward from the hips while seated, keeping your back flat, and pin your upper arms at your sides before extending.
- Squeeze the triceps at full extension and hold for one second before slowly lowering back to the 90-degree starting position.
- Exhale as you extend and focus on feeling the contraction at the back of your upper arm, not the shoulder.

## Common mistakes

- Not leaning forward enough, which reduces the effective range of motion and makes the exercise too easy at the bottom.
- Swinging the dumbbells using shoulder movement rather than extending purely from the elbow joint.
- Sitting upright, which changes the gravity vector and removes tension from the triceps through most of the range.

## FAQ

### Are seated kickbacks as effective as standing kickbacks?

Yes. The seated position provides stability and prevents leg drive. The key is leaning forward enough that gravity loads the triceps through the full range.

### Why do I feel seated kickbacks more in my shoulders than triceps?

Your upper arm is likely moving instead of staying locked at your side. Pin the elbow and only move from the elbow down.

### What weight is right for seated kickbacks?

Light to moderate, typically 8-15 lbs per hand. If you cannot fully extend the arm with a 1-second hold, the weight is too heavy.

### What muscles does the Dumbbell Seated Kickback work?

The Dumbbell Seated Kickback primarily targets the triceps, with secondary activation in the shoulders. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.

### Is the Dumbbell Seated Kickback good for beginners?
