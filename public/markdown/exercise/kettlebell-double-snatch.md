## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a kettlebell in each hand at arm's length in front of your thighs.
2. Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back flat and chest up.
3. In one explosive motion, extend your hips, knees, and ankles, and simultaneously pull the kettlebells up towards your shoulders.
4. As the kettlebells reach shoulder level, rotate your wrists and punch the kettlebells overhead, fully extending your arms.
5. Lower the kettlebells back down to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hike both kettlebells back between your legs with a powerful hip hinge, then snap your hips forward to drive them overhead in one fluid motion.
- Punch through at the top to insert your hands into the handles and lock out both arms simultaneously.
- Keep the kettlebells close to your body on the way up, as if zipping up a jacket, to reduce the arc and improve efficiency.

## Common mistakes

- Trying to muscle the kettlebells overhead with arm strength instead of using hip power to project them.
- Letting the kettlebells swing wide in a big arc, which is inefficient and stresses the shoulders.
- Not inserting the hands at the top, causing the bells to crash down onto the forearms.
