## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent.
2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing your body.
3. Bend forward at the waist, keeping your back straight and your core engaged.
4. Extend your arms straight down towards the floor, with a slight bend in your elbows.
5. Raise the dumbbells out to the sides, squeezing your shoulder blades together.
6. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Flare your elbows out to the sides at about 90 degrees rather than pulling them straight back, which targets the rear delts instead of the lats.
- Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top and hold for one second to maximize rear delt and rhomboid activation.
- Hinge forward at the hips to at least 45 degrees with a flat back to position your torso correctly for rear delt emphasis.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling the elbows back close to the body like a standard row, which works the lats instead of the rear delts.
- Standing too upright, which changes the angle and turns this into more of an upright row movement.
- Using too much weight and rounding the lower back, which stresses the spine and reduces rear delt isolation.
