4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your arms back down to the starting position.

## Pro tips

- Raise the dumbbells at roughly a 45-degree angle from your body, forming a Y shape when viewed from above.
- Use very light weight (3-8 lbs) and focus on squeezing the lower traps and rear delts at the top.
- Keep a slight bend in your elbows and lead the movement with your thumbs pointing upward.

## Common mistakes

- Using too heavy a weight, which forces you to use momentum and shrug your upper traps instead of targeting the lower traps.
- Raising the arms straight out to the sides (T-raise pattern) instead of at the 45-degree Y angle.
- Lifting the chest off the bench to assist the movement, which removes the isolation benefit.
