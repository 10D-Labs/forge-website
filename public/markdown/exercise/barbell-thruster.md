## How to perform

1. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a barbell at shoulder height with an overhand grip.
2. Lower into a squat position by bending your knees and pushing your hips back.
3. As you reach the bottom of the squat, explosively drive through your heels to stand up, simultaneously pressing the barbell overhead.
4. Lower the barbell back to shoulder height as you lower back into the squat position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep the bar in a front rack position with elbows high, and drive it overhead as you stand up from the squat in one fluid motion.
- Use the momentum from your hip and knee extension to power the press, don't stop at the top of the squat.
- Breathe in at the top, brace your core, then descend into the squat and exhale as you drive up and press.

## Common mistakes

- Pausing at the top of the squat before pressing, which kills momentum and makes the movement much harder.
- Letting the elbows drop during the front squat portion, which causes the bar to roll forward and dumps your position.
- Using too wide a grip, which limits your pressing mechanics overhead and reduces power transfer.
