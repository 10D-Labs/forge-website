## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with your feet flat on the ground and a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing forward.
2. Keep your back straight and your elbows close to your torso.
3. Exhale and curl the dumbbells up towards your shoulders, contracting your biceps.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Sit upright with your back against the bench and curl both dumbbells simultaneously, keeping your elbows pinned to your sides.
- Supinate your wrists as you curl (turn palms up) to maximize bicep peak contraction at the top.
- The seated position prevents any hip thrust or body swing, making each rep stricter than standing curls.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning forward or rocking the torso to generate momentum, which negates the benefit of the seated position.
- Letting the elbows drift forward during the curl, which shifts the load to the front delts.
- Not fully extending the arms at the bottom, shortening the range of motion and missing the stretch.
