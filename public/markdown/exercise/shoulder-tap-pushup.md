## How to perform

1. Start in a high plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and your body in a straight line from head to heels.
2. Lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows, keeping them close to your sides.
3. As you push back up, lift your right hand off the ground and tap your left shoulder.
4. Return your right hand to the ground and repeat the pushup, this time lifting your left hand and tapping your right shoulder.
5. Continue alternating shoulder taps with each pushup repetition.
6. Maintain a stable core and avoid excessive hip rotation throughout the exercise.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Widen your foot stance to create a more stable base during the Shoulder Tap, preventing hip rotation.
- Tap your shoulder quickly and with minimal weight shift; the goal is to challenge anti-rotation of the core.
- Complete the full Pushup before tapping; don't tap at the bottom or midway through the press.

## Common mistakes

- Rocking the hips side to side during the tap, which means the core isn't stabilizing properly. Widen the feet to fix this.
- Rushing through the Pushup to get to the tap, resulting in sloppy Pushup form.
- Lifting the hand too high or holding the tap too long, which throws off balance unnecessarily.
