## How to perform

1. Adjust the smith machine bar to a height just below your shoulders.
2. Stand facing the bar with your feet hip-width apart and toes pointing forward.
3. Place the balls of your feet on the edge of a step or platform, with your heels hanging off.
4. Hold onto the bar for support, keeping your back straight and core engaged.
5. Raise your heels as high as possible, lifting your body weight onto the balls of your feet.
6. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your heels back down to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep the balls of your feet on the platform edge and raise your toes toward your shins, not your heels.
- Squeeze the tibialis anterior (front of the shin) at the top of each rep and hold for 1-2 seconds.
- Use a slow, controlled tempo since the tibialis anterior is a small muscle that responds to time under tension.

## Common mistakes

- Confusing this with regular calf raises; the reverse version lifts the toes up, not the heels.
- Using too much weight and shortening the range of motion.
- Rushing through reps instead of controlling the movement to feel the shin muscles working.
