2. Hold a dumbbell in one hand with a neutral grip (palms facing each other).

4. Keeping your upper arm stationary, exhale and curl the dumbbell up towards your shoulder.

6. Inhale and slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position.

## Pro tips

- Brace your working elbow against the inside of your thigh for extra stabilization, similar to a concentration curl position.
- Keep the dumbbell in a neutral position (thumb up) throughout the entire movement.
- Focus on a slow, controlled curl and an even slower lowering phase for maximum brachialis engagement.

## Common mistakes

- Rotating the wrist at the top, converting it into a regular supinated curl and losing the hammer curl emphasis.
- Lifting the elbow off the thigh during the curl, which allows the shoulder to contribute.
- Using excessive weight and compromising the strict form that makes the seated single-arm version effective.
