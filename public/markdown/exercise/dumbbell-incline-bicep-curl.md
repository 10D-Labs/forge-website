## How to perform

1. Sit on an incline bench with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing forward, and arms fully extended.
2. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps.
3. Continue to raise the dumbbells until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level.
4. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
5. Inhale and slowly begin to lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Set the bench at 45-60 degrees and let your arms hang straight down. This starting position places the biceps in a fully stretched position, which increases the muscle-building stimulus.
- Do not let your elbows drift forward as you curl. Keep them pointing straight down throughout.
- Use lighter weight than standing curls. The extreme stretch makes this exercise significantly harder with less weight.

## Common mistakes

- Setting the bench too upright, which reduces the bicep stretch and makes this no different from a standing curl.
- Swinging the elbows forward to make the curl easier, which eliminates the stretch advantage of the incline position.
- Using the same weight as standing curls, which is too heavy for the stretched position and leads to sloppy form.

## FAQ

### Why are incline Bicep Curls so much harder?

The incline position places the long head of the biceps in a fully stretched position at the bottom of the curl. Muscles are weakest in their stretched position, so less weight produces more effort and muscle fiber recruitment.

### What angle should the bench be for incline curls?

45-60 degrees works best. A 45-degree angle provides a moderate stretch, while 60 degrees provides a deeper stretch. Do not go below 30 degrees as it can strain the bicep tendon.

### What muscles does the Dumbbell Incline Bicep Curl work?

The Dumbbell Incline Bicep Curl primarily targets the biceps, with secondary activation in the forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.

### Is the Dumbbell Incline Bicep Curl good for beginners?

The Dumbbell Incline Bicep Curl is rated as intermediate. Beginners should build a base of biceps strength with easier variations first.
