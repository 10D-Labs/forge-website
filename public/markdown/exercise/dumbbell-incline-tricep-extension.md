## Pro tips

- Lie back on an incline bench and extend the dumbbells overhead with palms facing each other.
- Lower the dumbbells by bending at the elbows, bringing them beside your head while keeping your upper arms stationary.
- The incline position adds a stretch to the long head of the triceps that a flat bench doesn't provide.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the elbows flare out wide, which reduces the stretch on the tricep long head.
- Lowering the dumbbells too far behind the head, which puts excessive stress on the shoulder joint.
- Moving the upper arms during the extension instead of keeping them fixed perpendicular to the floor.
