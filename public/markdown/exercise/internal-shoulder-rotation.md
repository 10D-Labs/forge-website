## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench or chair facing the cable machine with your feet flat on the ground.
2. Hold the cable handle with your arm extended straight out in front of you, parallel to the ground.
3. Keep your elbow slightly bent and your shoulder blades pulled back and down.
4. Slowly rotate your arm inward, bringing the cable handle towards the center of your body.
5. Pause for a moment at the end of the movement, then slowly return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch arms.

## Pro tips

- Keep your elbow bent at 90 degrees and pinned to your side throughout the entire movement. Only your forearm should rotate inward.
- Use very light weight. This is a rotator cuff exercise for shoulder health, not a strength builder. 2-5 lbs is often sufficient.
- Perform the rotation slowly and deliberately, taking 2 seconds in each direction, to build endurance in the subscapularis.

## Common mistakes

- Using too much weight, which recruits the pecs and lats to assist and defeats the purpose of isolating the rotator cuff.
- Letting the elbow drift away from the torso during the rotation, which changes the movement pattern and reduces subscapularis activation.
- Rushing through reps without controlling the eccentric, which misses the stabilization benefit of the exercise.
