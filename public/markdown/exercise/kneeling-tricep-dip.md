## How to perform

1. Adjust the machine to your desired weight and height.
2. Kneel down on the pad facing the machine, with your hands gripping the handles.
3. Lower your body by bending your elbows, keeping your back straight and close to the machine.
4. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push yourself back up to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your elbows pointing straight back, not flaring out, to keep maximum tension on the triceps.
- Lock out fully at the top of each rep and squeeze the triceps hard for a one-second hold.
- Maintain an upright torso position to prevent chest and shoulder muscles from dominating the movement.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning forward too much, which shifts the emphasis from triceps to chest.
- Using momentum and bouncing at the bottom of the rep instead of pressing with controlled force.
- Gripping the handles too tightly, which fatigues the forearms before the triceps are fully worked.
