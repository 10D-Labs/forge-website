- Drive your elbows straight back, not out to the sides, to target the middle traps and rhomboids along with the lats.
- Fully extend your arms on the return to get a complete stretch in the lats before the next rep.

- Excessive torso rocking back and forth to generate momentum, which takes tension off the back muscles and stresses the lower back.
- Pulling with the biceps by not initiating the movement with the shoulder blades. Think about pinching a pencil between your shoulder blades first.
- Rounding the upper back and letting the shoulders roll forward at the extended position.
