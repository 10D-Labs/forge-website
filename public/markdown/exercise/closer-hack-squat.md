## How to perform

1. Adjust the leg press machine to a comfortable weight and position yourself with your back against the pad.
2. Place your feet shoulder-width apart on the platform, toes slightly pointed outwards.
3. Grip the handles on the sides of the machine for stability.
4. Engage your core and slowly lower your body by bending your knees and hips, keeping your back straight.
5. Continue lowering until your thighs are parallel to the ground or slightly below.
6. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push through your heels to extend your legs and return to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your feet close together (6-8 inches apart) to shift more emphasis onto the outer quads.
- Drive through the full foot, keeping your heels down throughout the movement.
- Keep your back flat against the pad and avoid letting your hips drift forward at the bottom.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the knees travel too far forward past the toes, which increases shear force on the knee joint.
- Rising onto the toes at the bottom of the squat, which means the weight is too heavy or ankles lack mobility.
- Not going deep enough; aim for thighs at least parallel to the platform for full quad development.

## FAQ

### What's the difference between a closer stance and regular Hack Squat?

The closer stance increases the range of motion at the knee and shifts more emphasis to the vastus lateralis (outer quad) and the overall quadriceps, while the wider stance involves more inner thigh and glutes.

### Is the Closer Hack Squat harder on the knees?

The closer stance does create slightly more knee flexion. If you have knee issues, use a moderate depth and ensure your knees track over your toes without caving inward.

### Can I use the Closer Hack Squat to build bigger quads?

Yes. It's one of the best quad isolation movements because the machine removes balance demands, letting you focus entirely on pushing through the quads.

### What muscles does the Closer Hack Squat work?

The Closer Hack Squat primarily targets the glutes, with secondary activation in the quadriceps, hamstrings, calves. It's classified as a strength exercise for the legs.
