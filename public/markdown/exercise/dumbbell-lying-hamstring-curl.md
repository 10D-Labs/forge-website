## How to perform

1. Lie flat on your back with your legs extended and a dumbbell resting on your lower abdomen.
2. Bend your knees and bring the dumbbell towards your glutes, keeping your feet flat on the ground.
3. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Secure the dumbbell between your feet firmly before starting so it does not slip during the curling motion.
- Curl your heels toward your glutes in a smooth arc, squeezing the hamstrings hard at the top.
- Lower the dumbbell slowly over 2-3 seconds to load the hamstrings eccentrically, which is where most growth stimulus occurs.

## Common mistakes

- Lifting the hips off the bench during the curl, which uses hip flexor momentum instead of isolating the hamstrings.
- Not securing the dumbbell properly between the feet, causing it to slip and creating a safety hazard.
- Using a jerky, fast motion instead of a controlled curl, which reduces hamstring activation and risks straining the knee.
