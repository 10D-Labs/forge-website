## How to perform

1. Lie flat on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground.
2. Place your hands behind your head with your elbows pointing outwards.
3. Engaging your abs, slowly lift your upper body off the ground, curling forward until your torso is at a 45 degree angle.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your upper body back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Curl up until your torso reaches roughly 45 degrees, then lower back down with control.
- Keep your feet flat on the floor without anchoring them under anything to keep the abs doing the work.
- Exhale as you curl up and inhale as you lower to maintain steady breathing.

## Common mistakes

- Going all the way up into a full sit-up, which recruits the hip flexors excessively.
- Anchoring the feet, which allows the hip flexors to dominate the movement.
- Using a jerky motion to get past the sticking point rather than controlled ab contraction.

## FAQ

### What is the difference between a half sit-up and a crunch?

A half sit-up lifts the torso to about 45 degrees, which is more than a crunch (which only lifts the shoulder blades). The half sit-up involves more rectus abdominis range of motion.

### Are half sit-ups safe for the back?

They are safer than full sit-ups because they reduce the hip flexor involvement that pulls on the lumbar spine. Keep your lower back supported and do not anchor your feet.

### Can half sit-ups replace full sit-ups?

For most people, yes. Half sit-ups provide sufficient ab activation while reducing lower back stress compared to full sit-ups.

### What muscles does the Half Situp work?

The Half Situp primarily targets the abs, with secondary activation in the hip flexors. It's classified as a strength exercise for the core.
