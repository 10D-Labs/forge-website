## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand at your sides.
2. Raise your arms out to the sides until they are parallel to the ground, forming a T shape with your body.
3. Pause for a moment, then slowly lower your arms back down to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep a slight bend in your elbows throughout and resist the urge to lock them out, which protects the joint under the sustained lateral load.
- Raise both arms simultaneously at the same speed to build balanced shoulder strength and avoid compensating with one side.
- Control the lowering phase for 2-3 seconds to maximize time under tension on the lateral delts.

## Common mistakes

- Using momentum to swing the dumbbells up to parallel, which defeats the purpose of this strict lateral hold exercise.
- Shrugging the shoulders up during the hold, which shifts work from the lateral delts to the upper traps.
- Holding the T-position too long with weight that is too heavy, which can strain the rotator cuff muscles.
