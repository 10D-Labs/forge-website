## How to perform

1. Sit on an incline bench with a dumbbell in one hand, resting it on your thigh.
2. Lean forward and position your upper arm against the inside of your thigh.
3. Raise the dumbbell to the side, keeping your arm slightly bent and your palm facing down.
4. Continue lifting until your arm is parallel to the floor.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch to the other arm.

## Pro tips

- Lean into the incline bench to eliminate body English and force the lateral delt to do all the work without momentum.
- Lead with your elbow, not your hand, and keep a slight bend in the elbow to protect the joint and maintain constant tension.
- Stop just before your arm reaches parallel to the ground to keep tension on the lateral delt rather than shifting it to the traps.

## Common mistakes

- Rotating the wrist so the thumb points upward, which turns this into more of a front raise and reduces lateral delt activation.
- Swinging the dumbbell up using body momentum instead of a slow, controlled lift from the shoulder.
- Shrugging the shoulder up toward the ear at the top of the movement, recruiting the upper traps instead of isolating the lateral delt.
