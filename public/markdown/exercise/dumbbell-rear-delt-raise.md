## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing your body.
2. Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight.
3. Raise your arms out to the sides, keeping a slight bend in your elbows, until they are parallel to the floor.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your arms back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lead with your elbows, not your hands; imagine pouring water out of a pitcher as you raise your arms.
- Keep your torso hinged at roughly 45-60 degrees and avoid raising up during the lift.
- Use a brief pause at the top of each rep to confirm you feel the contraction in the rear delts, not the traps.

## Common mistakes

- Lifting the torso upward during each rep, which turns the exercise into a shrug and shifts work to the traps.
- Using too much weight and swinging the dumbbells up with momentum rather than controlled rear delt contraction.
- Bending the elbows excessively during the raise, which shortens the lever arm and reduces rear delt activation.
