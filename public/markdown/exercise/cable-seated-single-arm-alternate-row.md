## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench facing a cable machine with your feet flat on the ground and knees slightly bent.
2. Grasp the handle with one hand and keep your arm fully extended in front of you.
3. Pull the handle towards your body, retracting your shoulder blade and keeping your elbow close to your side.
4. Pause for a moment at the top of the movement, squeezing your back muscles.
5. Slowly release the handle back to the starting position.
6. Repeat with the other arm.
7. Alternate between arms for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Alternate arms each rep to allow brief recovery for each side, which lets you maintain quality reps longer than bilateral rowing.
- Keep your torso square and avoid rotating toward the pulling arm. The non-working arm should stay extended as a counterbalance.
- Initiate each pull with the shoulder blade, not the hand, to ensure the upper back muscles engage before the bicep.

## Common mistakes

- Rotating the torso toward the pulling arm to generate momentum, which reduces upper back isolation.
- Pulling both arms simultaneously instead of alternating, which defeats the unilateral balance benefit.
- Rushing the alternation and not fully completing the contraction on each side before switching.
