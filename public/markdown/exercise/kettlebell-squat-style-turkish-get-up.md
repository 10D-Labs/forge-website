## Pro tips

- Keep your eyes on the kettlebell for the first half of the movement (floor to kneeling) to maintain shoulder stability.
- The squat-style get-up transitions from the half-kneeling position by sweeping the rear leg forward into a squat instead of lunging up. This requires more mobility.
- Move through each position deliberately. The Turkish get-up is a skill exercise, not a speed exercise.

## Common mistakes

- Rushing through the transitions instead of pausing at each position to ensure stability.
- Bending the overhead arm, which destabilizes the kettlebell and puts the shoulder at risk.
- Skipping the roll-to-elbow and elbow-to-hand transitions, which are critical for building the foundation of the movement.
