## How to Perform Barbell Clean Grip Front Squat

1. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and the barbell resting on your upper chest, with your elbows pointing forward.
2. Lower your body by bending your knees and pushing your hips back, as if you are sitting back into a chair.
3. Keep your chest up and your back straight as you lower down, making sure your knees do not go past your toes.
4. Continue lowering until your thighs are parallel to the ground, or as low as you can comfortably go.
5. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push through your heels to stand back up, extending your hips and knees.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
