## How to perform

1. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and the barbell resting on your upper chest, with your elbows pointing forward.
2. Lower your body by bending your knees and pushing your hips back, as if you are sitting back into a chair.
3. Keep your chest up and your back straight as you lower down, making sure your knees do not go past your toes.
4. Continue lowering until your thighs are parallel to the ground, or as low as you can comfortably go.
5. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push through your heels to stand back up, extending your hips and knees.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your elbows as high as possible throughout the movement; they should point forward, not down, to prevent the bar from rolling off your shoulders.
- Work on wrist and thoracic spine mobility separately if you struggle to maintain the clean grip rack position.
- Inhale and brace your core hard at the top of each rep before descending to create intra-abdominal pressure and protect your spine.

## Common mistakes

- Dropping the elbows during the descent, which causes the bar to roll forward and pull you out of position.
- Shifting weight to the toes instead of keeping it evenly distributed or slightly back on the heels.
- Cutting depth short because the upright torso position feels harder than a back squat at the same depth.

## FAQ

### What's the difference between a clean grip and cross-arm front squat?

The clean grip has your fingertips under the bar with elbows high, matching the position you'd catch a clean in. Cross-arm has your arms crossed over the bar. Clean grip develops better overhead lifting transfer and forces more upright posture.

### My wrists hurt during clean grip front squats. What should I do?

You only need 2-3 fingers under the bar, not a full grip. Work on wrist mobility and lat flexibility. You can also widen your grip slightly or use lifting straps wrapped around the bar as handles.

### How much less can I front squat compared to back squat?

Most people front squat 70-85% of their back squat. If it's less than 70%, your upper back or core strength is likely the limiting factor, not your legs.

The Barbell Clean Grip Front Squat primarily targets the glutes, with secondary activation in the quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, core. It's classified as a strength exercise for the legs.
