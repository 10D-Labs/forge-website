2. Hold the band with your palms facing forward and raise your hands to shoulder height, elbows bent.
3. Press the band overhead, fully extending your arms.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the band back to shoulder height.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

- Stand on the center of the band with both feet and press straight overhead, fully extending the arms.
- Keep your core braced and ribs down to prevent your lower back from arching as you press.

- Not pressing to full lockout overhead, which reduces the range of motion and shoulder engagement.
- Standing on the band unevenly, creating different resistance for each arm.
