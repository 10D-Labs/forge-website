4. Pull the barbell towards your lower chest, squeezing your shoulder blades together.

## Pro tips

- Hinge forward until your torso is roughly 45-60 degrees from the floor, keeping a flat back with chest up.
- Pull the bar to your lower chest or upper abdomen, driving your elbows past your torso and squeezing your shoulder blades together.
- Keep the bar close to your body throughout the pull. It should almost scrape your thighs on the way up.

## Common mistakes

- Standing too upright, which turns the row into a shrug and reduces lat and mid-back engagement.
- Using excessive body English by jerking the torso upward to heave the weight up.
- Rounding the lower back under heavy loads, which puts the lumbar spine at serious risk.
