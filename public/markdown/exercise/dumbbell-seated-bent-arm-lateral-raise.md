## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with your back straight and feet flat on the ground.
2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing your body and your arms bent at a 90 degree angle.
3. Keeping your elbows bent, raise your arms out to the sides until they are parallel to the ground.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your arms back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Maintain a strict 90-degree bend in your elbows throughout the entire raise to keep the lever arm consistent.
- Raise your arms only to shoulder height; going higher shifts the work from the lateral delts to the traps.
- Sit with your back flat against the bench to prevent momentum from your torso.

## Common mistakes

- Straightening the arms as you lift, which makes the exercise harder on the joints rather than the shoulders.
- Shrugging the shoulders up during the raise, which recruits the upper traps and takes tension off the lateral delts.
- Using momentum by rocking the torso, which reduces the isolation benefit of the seated position.
