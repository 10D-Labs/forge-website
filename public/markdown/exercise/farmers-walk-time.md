1. Stand up straight with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing your sides.
2. Keep your back straight and your shoulders back.
3. Take small, controlled steps forward, maintaining an upright posture.
4. Continue walking for your target duration.
5. To finish, stop walking and carefully lower the dumbbells to your sides.

## Pro tips

- Pack your shoulders down and back before you start walking; think about putting your shoulder blades in your back pockets.
- Take short, controlled steps rather than long strides to maintain an upright torso and even weight distribution.
- Grip the dumbbells as hard as possible throughout the walk to build forearm strength and maintain control.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning forward or to one side during the walk, which indicates the weight is too heavy or core engagement is lacking.
- Shrugging the shoulders up toward the ears, which fatigues the upper traps and takes emphasis away from the intended full-body carry effect.
- Taking overly long strides, which causes the torso to sway and reduces core stabilization benefits.
