## How to perform

1. Attach a cable handle to a low pulley and stand facing the machine.
2. Grasp the handle with your left hand and step away from the machine, extending your arm fully.
3. Position your feet shoulder-width apart, with your knees slightly bent.
4. Keep your back straight and your core engaged throughout the exercise.
5. Pull the handle towards your body, rotating your torso to the right as you do so.
6. Squeeze your back muscles at the end of the movement.
7. Slowly return to the starting position, keeping tension on the cable.
8. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch sides and perform with your right hand.

## Pro tips

- Start with the cable low and pull diagonally across your body while rotating your torso. This combines a single-arm row with a trunk rotation for compound back and core work.
- Let your torso rotate naturally with the pull, finishing with your chest facing away from the cable machine.
- Control the return by slowly untwisting your torso while extending your arm back toward the machine.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling with the arm without rotating the torso, which eliminates the core training component.
- Using too much weight and jerking the cable rather than performing a controlled rotational pull.
- Not switching sides, which creates imbalances in the lats and obliques between left and right.
