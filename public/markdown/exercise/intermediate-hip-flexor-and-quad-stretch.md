## How to perform

1. Stand upright with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Hold onto a stable object for support.
3. Bend your right knee and bring your right foot towards your glutes, grabbing the rope with your right hand.
4. Slowly pull your right foot towards your glutes, feeling a stretch in your right quad.
5. Hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds.
6. Release the stretch and repeat on the left side.

## Pro tips

- Use the resistance band to gently assist pulling your heel closer to your glutes for a deeper quad stretch than you could achieve by hand alone.
- Keep your standing leg's knee slightly bent to maintain balance and protect the supporting knee.
- Tuck your pelvis slightly under (posterior tilt) to intensify the hip flexor stretch component.

## Common mistakes

- Arching the lower back excessively, which compresses the lumbar spine and reduces the hip flexor stretch.
- Pulling the foot too aggressively with the band, overshooting your current flexibility and straining the quad.
- Leaning forward at the waist instead of staying upright, which shifts the stretch away from the hip flexor.
