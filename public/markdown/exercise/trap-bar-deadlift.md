## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and the trap bar on the ground in front of you.
2. Bend at the hips and knees to lower yourself down and grip the handles of the trap bar with an overhand grip.
3. Keep your back straight and chest up as you begin to lift the trap bar off the ground by extending your hips and knees.
4. As you lift, focus on driving through your heels and squeezing your glutes at the top of the movement.
5. Lower the trap bar back down to the ground by bending at the hips and knees, keeping your back straight throughout the movement.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep the trap bar handles in line with your mid-foot, not in front of you like a conventional Deadlift.
- Drive through your entire foot and think about pushing the floor away rather than pulling the bar up.
- Squeeze your lats before initiating the pull to lock in your upper back position.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning too far forward and turning the movement into a conventional Deadlift pattern instead of staying centered in the frame.
- Locking out the knees before the hips, which places excessive stress on the lower back.
- Letting the hips shoot up first, losing the quad-dominant advantage the trap bar provides.
