## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height and footplate position to ensure proper alignment.
2. Sit on the machine with your back straight and feet flat on the footplate.
3. Grasp the handles with a narrow grip, palms facing each other.
4. Keep your chest up and shoulders back throughout the exercise.
5. Pull one handle towards your torso while keeping the other handle stationary.
6. Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the end of the movement.
7. Slowly return the handle to the starting position and repeat with the other side.
8. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your chest pressed against the pad and pull one handle at a time to your lower ribcage, squeezing the shoulder blade back.
- Resist the urge to rotate your torso toward the pulling arm. Stay square to the machine for true anti-rotation core work.
- Pause for one second at peak contraction on each arm before slowly returning to the start.

## Common mistakes

- Rotating the torso with each pull instead of keeping the chest square to the pad.
- Using body momentum by leaning back to pull the handle rather than isolating the back muscles.
- Not fully extending the arm on the return, which shortens the range of motion and limits the stretch.
