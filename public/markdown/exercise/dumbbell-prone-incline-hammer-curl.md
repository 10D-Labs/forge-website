## How to perform

1. Adjust the bench to a 45 degree incline.
2. Lie face down on the bench with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing each other.
3. Allow your arms to hang straight down towards the floor, keeping your elbows slightly bent.
4. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps.
5. Continue to raise the dumbbells until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level.
6. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
7. Inhale and slowly begin to lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
8. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lie chest-down on a 45-degree incline bench and let your arms hang straight down for a full stretch before curling.
- The prone position eliminates all body swing, so focus purely on squeezing the brachialis at the top.
- Keep your elbows pointed at the floor and stationary; only your forearms should move.

## Common mistakes

- Lifting the chest off the bench during the curl, which introduces momentum and reduces isolation.
- Swinging the elbows back to help lift the weight instead of keeping them fixed.
- Using too much weight since the prone position removes all cheating ability; start lighter than you think.

## FAQ

The prone position eliminates all body English and momentum. With gravity pulling straight down and your chest braced against the bench, every rep is pure brachialis and bicep contraction.

### What angle should the bench be?

A 45-degree incline works best. Steeper angles make it harder to maintain contact with the bench; shallower angles reduce the gravitational challenge.

### How does this compare to regular hammer curls?

You'll use significantly less weight because you can't cheat at all. The trade-off is much higher quality muscle activation and better brachialis development.

The Dumbbell Prone Incline Hammer Curl primarily targets the biceps, with secondary activation in the forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.
