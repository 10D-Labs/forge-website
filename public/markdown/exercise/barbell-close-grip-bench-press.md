## How to perform

1. Lie flat on a bench with your feet flat on the ground and your back pressed against the bench.
2. Grasp the barbell with a close grip, slightly narrower than shoulder-width apart.
3. Unrack the barbell and lower it slowly towards your chest, keeping your elbows close to your body.
4. Pause for a moment when the barbell touches your chest.
5. Push the barbell back up to the starting position, fully extending your arms.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Place your hands about shoulder-width apart or slightly narrower; going too narrow puts unnecessary stress on the wrists.
- Tuck your elbows to about 30 degrees from your torso and lower the bar to your lower chest or sternum area.
- Focus on locking out each rep with force and squeezing the triceps hard at the top.

## Common mistakes

- Gripping too narrow (hands touching), which causes wrist pain and shoulder impingement without additional tricep benefit.
- Flaring the elbows wide, which turns it into a regular bench press and takes tension off the triceps.
- Lowering the bar to the upper chest or neck instead of the lower chest, which stresses the shoulders.
