## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly turned out.
2. Hold the barbell across your upper back, resting it on your traps or rear delts.
3. Engage your core and keep your chest up as you lower your hips back and down, as if sitting into a chair.
4. Lower until your thighs are parallel to the ground, or as low as you can comfortably go.
5. Drive through your heels to stand back up, squeezing your glutes at the top.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use 50-60% of your one-rep max and focus on moving the bar as fast as possible on the way up while maintaining perfect form.
- Descend in a controlled manner (2 seconds), then explode out of the bottom as fast as you can.
- Keep sets to 2-3 reps so every rep is maximally explosive; fatigue kills speed.

## Common mistakes

- Using too much weight, which slows the bar speed and turns speed squats into regular heavy squats.
- Sacrificing squat depth for speed; still hit at least parallel on every rep.
- Relaxing at the bottom instead of maintaining tension and reversing direction explosively.
