## How to perform

1. Set an incline bench to a 45 degree angle and sit on it with a dumbbell in each hand.
2. Place your feet flat on the ground and let your arms hang straight down with your palms facing your body.
3. Keeping your arms straight, shrug your shoulders up towards your ears as high as possible.
4. Hold the contraction for a moment, then slowly lower your shoulders back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Let the dumbbells hang fully at the bottom to get a complete stretch on the traps before shrugging up.
- Shrug straight up toward your ears rather than rolling the shoulders, which adds unnecessary joint stress without extra benefit.
- Hold the top contraction for 1-2 seconds on every rep to maximize trap activation in this unique incline angle.

## Common mistakes

- Rolling the shoulders in circles instead of shrugging straight up and down, which stresses the shoulder joint unnecessarily.
- Bending the elbows to help lift the weight, which turns it into a partial row and takes work off the traps.
- Using the incline angle too steeply, which limits range of motion and reduces the effectiveness of the shrug.

## FAQ

### How is an incline shrug different from a standing shrug?

The incline position shifts the line of pull so the traps are loaded through a different angle, emphasizing the mid and lower traps more than standing shrugs, which primarily hit the upper traps.

### What angle should the bench be for incline shrugs?

45 degrees is standard. A steeper angle hits more upper traps; a lower angle biases the mid traps and rhomboids.

### Can incline shrugs help with posture?

Yes. They strengthen the mid and lower traps, which are key muscles for pulling the shoulder blades back and correcting rounded-shoulder posture.
