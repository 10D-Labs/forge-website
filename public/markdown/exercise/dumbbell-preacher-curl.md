## How to perform

1. Sit on a preacher curl bench with your upper arms resting on the pad and your chest against it.
2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing up and your arms fully extended.
3. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps.
4. Continue to raise the dumbbells until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level.
5. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
6. Inhale and slowly begin to lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Set the preacher pad height so your armpits rest comfortably at the top edge, with your upper arms flat against the pad.
- Lower the dumbbells until your arms are nearly fully extended (slight bend remaining) to get the full stretch benefit.
- Curl both dumbbells evenly and squeeze the biceps hard at the top before lowering with a controlled 2-second negative.

## Common mistakes

- Setting the pad too high or too low, which either limits range of motion or causes the shoulders to compensate.
- Slamming the arms to full extension at the bottom, which puts excessive stress on the elbow tendons.
- Lifting the elbows off the pad during the curl to cheat the weight up past the sticking point.

## FAQ

### Why do Preacher Curls instead of standing curls?

The preacher pad locks your upper arms in place, eliminating shoulder swing and momentum. This creates stricter biceps isolation, especially in the lower portion of the curl.

### Are Preacher Curls harder than standing curls?

Yes. The locked upper arm position removes all momentum, and the angle creates peak difficulty at the bottom where the bicep is stretched, which most people find harder.

### Can Preacher Curls cause elbow pain?

They can if you hyperextend at the bottom or use too much weight. Always maintain a slight bend at the bottom and control the eccentric phase.

The Dumbbell Preacher Curl primarily targets the biceps, with secondary activation in the forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.
