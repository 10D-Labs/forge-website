## How to perform

1. Adjust the bench to a comfortable position on the smith machine.
2. Lie down on the bench with your feet flat on the ground.
3. Grasp the barbell with a wide grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
4. Unrack the barbell and lower it slowly towards your chest, keeping your elbows out to the sides.
5. Pause for a moment when the barbell touches your chest.
6. Push the barbell back up to the starting position, fully extending your arms.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Position the bench so the bar path aligns with your mid-chest, not your throat or lower ribs.
- Use a grip 1.5 times shoulder width to maximize chest stretch while keeping the shoulders in a safe range.
- Unrack by rotating the bar hooks, then lower slowly with full control since the fixed path removes your ability to adjust mid-rep.

## Common mistakes

- Placing the bench too far forward or back under the Smith bar, which forces an unnatural bar path relative to the chest.
- Bouncing the bar off the chest to move heavier weight, which risks rib bruising and kills muscle tension.
- Flaring the elbows to a full 90 degrees, which combined with the wide grip puts the shoulders in a vulnerable position.
