## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold the barbell with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width.
2. Lift the barbell to shoulder height, keeping your elbows slightly in front of the bar.
3. Press the barbell overhead, extending your arms fully.
4. Lower the barbell back to shoulder height and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use a grip about 4-6 inches wider than shoulder width to maximize deltoid recruitment over tricep involvement.
- Tuck your chin slightly as the bar passes your face, then push your head through once the bar clears to stack the weight over your spine.
- Control the eccentric by taking 2-3 seconds to lower the bar back to your shoulders.

## Common mistakes

- Gripping so wide that wrist pain develops; your forearms should remain roughly vertical at the bottom of the press.
- Letting the bar drift forward during the press, which puts the shoulders in a mechanically weaker position.
- Using leg drive to push past sticking points, which turns the strict press into a push press and reduces shoulder stimulus.
