- The front-loaded position forces an extremely upright torso; use this to build incredible core and upper back strength.
- Start light to build tolerance in the elbow crease area before adding significant weight.

## Common mistakes

- Not using padding on the bar, which makes the exercise painfully uncomfortable in the elbow crease and limits how much you can lift.
- Letting the elbows drop and the bar slide down, collapsing the posture.
- Rounding the upper back because the front loading is demanding on the thoracic extensors.
