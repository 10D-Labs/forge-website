## How to perform

1. Adjust the leg press machine to a comfortable weight and position yourself on the machine with your toes on the platform and your heels hanging off.
2. Place your hands on the handles or the sides of the machine for support.
3. Engage your calves and slowly raise your heels as high as possible, pushing against the resistance of the sled.
4. Pause for a moment at the top of the movement, then slowly lower your heels back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lean your torso forward slightly against the sled to change the ankle angle and hit the calves differently than a standard calf raise.
- Rise all the way up onto the balls of your feet and hold the peak contraction for 2 seconds.
- Lower your heels slowly below the platform to get a full stretch at the bottom of each rep.

## Common mistakes

- Bouncing at the bottom of the rep instead of pausing in the stretched position.
- Bending the knees during the calf raise, which shifts the load from the gastrocnemius to the soleus.
- Using excessive weight that limits the range of motion to a few inches.
