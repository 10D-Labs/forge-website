## Pro tips

- Place your non-working hand on your knee or a bench for support and keep your torso parallel to the ground throughout.
- Pull the handle toward your lower chest, keeping your elbow tight to your ribs, and rotate your torso slightly at the top for extra range of motion.
- Let your shoulder blade protract fully at the bottom of each rep to get a complete lat stretch before retracting on the pull.

## Common mistakes

- Rotating the torso excessively to heave the weight up rather than using a controlled pull from the back muscles.
- Standing too upright, which turns this into a cable row rather than a Bent Over Row and reduces lat engagement.
- Pulling to the hip instead of the lower chest, which limits upper back and rhomboid involvement.
