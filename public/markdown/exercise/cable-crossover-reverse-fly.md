## How to perform

1. Attach a D-handle to each low pulley cable and stand in the middle of the cable crossover machine.
2. Grasp the handles with a pronated grip (palms facing down) and take a step forward, positioning your feet shoulder-width apart.
3. Bend your knees slightly and lean forward at the waist, keeping your back straight and your abs engaged.
4. With your arms extended out to the sides and slightly bent at the elbows, exhale and squeeze your shoulder blades together as you pull the cables back and upward in a reverse fly motion.
5. Pause for a moment at the peak contraction, then inhale and slowly return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Set the pulleys at the lowest position and cross the cables so your right hand holds the left cable and vice versa for a longer range of motion.
- Lead with your elbows, not your hands, and think about pulling your elbows apart to better isolate the rear deltoids.
- Keep a slight bend in your elbows locked throughout the movement. Straightening or bending more mid-rep shifts load off the rear delts.

## Common mistakes

- Using too much weight and turning the movement into a row by bending the elbows excessively during the pull.
- Standing too upright instead of hinging forward at the hips, which shifts the emphasis from rear delts to lateral delts and traps.
- Shrugging the shoulders up toward the ears, which recruits the upper traps and takes tension off the rear delts.
