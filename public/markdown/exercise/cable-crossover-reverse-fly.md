## How to Perform Cable Crossover Reverse Fly

1. Attach a D-handle to each low pulley cable and stand in the middle of the cable crossover machine.
2. Grasp the handles with a pronated grip (palms facing down) and take a step forward, positioning your feet shoulder-width apart.
3. Bend your knees slightly and lean forward at the waist, keeping your back straight and your abs engaged.
4. With your arms extended out to the sides and slightly bent at the elbows, exhale and squeeze your shoulder blades together as you pull the cables back and upward in a reverse fly motion.
5. Pause for a moment at the peak contraction, then inhale and slowly return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
