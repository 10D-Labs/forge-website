## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and wrap the band around a sturdy object at chest height.
2. Hold the band with both hands and step away from the anchor point, creating tension in the band.
3. Position yourself perpendicular to the anchor point, with your side facing the band.
4. Extend your arms straight out in front of you, keeping your hands at chest height.
5. Engage your core and press the band away from your chest, fully extending your arms.
6. Hold the position for a few seconds, then slowly bring the band back towards your chest.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch sides.

## Pro tips

- Press the band straight up overhead from chest height rather than horizontally, creating a vertical anti-rotation challenge.
- Brace your core as if preparing for impact before pressing the band upward.
- Hold the overhead position for 2-3 seconds before returning the band to your chest.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning toward the anchor point as you press overhead, indicating insufficient core bracing.
- Pressing too quickly without holding the extended position, which reduces the anti-lateral-flexion challenge.
- Standing too close to the anchor, resulting in minimal tension and core demand.
