## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, facing the cable machine.
2. Hold the cable handle with one hand, palm facing down, and stand far enough away from the machine so that there is tension on the cable.
3. Keep your arm straight and slowly raise it out to the side until it is parallel to the ground.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your arm back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch sides.

## Pro tips

- Stand with the cable behind your body (cable in the hand furthest from the machine) for the longest range of motion and best resistance curve.
- Lead with your elbow and keep your hand below your elbow throughout the raise to isolate the medial delt.
- Use your free hand to hold the machine frame for stability so you can focus entirely on the working shoulder.

## Common mistakes

- Raising the arm in front of the body rather than directly to the side, which shifts emphasis to the anterior deltoid.
- Shrugging the shoulder up during the raise, which recruits the upper trapezius and reduces medial delt work.
- Using momentum by leaning the torso away from the cable to swing the weight up.
