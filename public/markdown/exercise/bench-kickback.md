## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with your back against the bench and your feet flat on the ground.
2. Place your hands on the bench for support.
3. Engage your glutes and hamstrings, then lift your hips off the bench until your body forms a straight line from your knees to your shoulders.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your hips back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Place your hands on the bench and engage your glutes to drive your hips upward, squeezing hard at the top.
- Focus on the glute contraction rather than just lifting the hips; think about driving through your heels.
- Hold the top position for 2 seconds on each rep to maximize glute activation.

## Common mistakes

- Hyperextending the lower back at the top instead of achieving hip extension through glute contraction.
- Pushing through the toes instead of the heels, which recruits the quads more than the glutes.
- Not reaching full hip extension at the top, cutting the rep short.

## FAQ

### Are Bench Kickbacks effective for glute growth?

They're a good beginner glute exercise because they use body weight and teach the hip extension pattern. For more advanced glute training, progress to hip thrusts, glute bridges with weight, or Cable Kickbacks.

### How do Bench Kickbacks differ from glute bridges?

The bench provides an elevated surface, which can change the angle of hip extension slightly. Standard glute bridges are performed with your back on the floor. Both target the glutes through hip extension.

### Can I add weight to Bench Kickbacks?

Yes. Place a dumbbell or weight plate on your hips to add resistance. Once bodyweight becomes easy (15+ reps), adding external load is necessary for continued glute development.

### What muscles does the Bench Kickback work?

The Bench Kickback primarily targets the glutes, with secondary activation in the hamstrings. It's classified as a strength exercise for the legs.

### Is the Bench Kickback good for beginners?

Yes, the Bench Kickback is rated as a beginner-level exercise. It's a great starting point for building glutes strength.
