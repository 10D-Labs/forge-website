## How to perform

1. Lie flat on your back with your legs straight and your arms extended overhead, holding the band.
2. Engaging your abs, lift your legs and upper body off the ground simultaneously, reaching your hands towards your toes.
3. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your legs and upper body back down to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hold the band overhead and simultaneously raise your straight legs and upper body to form a V, reaching toward your toes.
- Keep both your arms and legs as straight as possible throughout the movement for maximum ab tension.
- Lower back down slowly for a 3-second eccentric to avoid crashing onto the floor.

## Common mistakes

- Bending the knees to make the movement easier, which significantly reduces lower ab engagement.
- Using momentum to fling the body up instead of controlled abdominal contraction.
- Not reaching high enough to fully close the V shape at the top of the movement.

## FAQ

The band provides resistance in the overhead position, making the abs work harder to bring the arms forward and toward the toes.

### How many Band V-ups should you aim for?

3 sets of 8-12 reps with controlled form. If you cannot maintain straight legs, regress to Tuck Crunches until you build sufficient core strength.

The Band V-up primarily targets the abs, with secondary activation in the hip flexors. It's classified as a strength exercise for the core.
