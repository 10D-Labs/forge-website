## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your toes pointing slightly outward.
2. Hold onto a stable object for balance if needed.
3. Slowly lower your body by bending your knees and leaning back, keeping your torso upright.
4. Continue lowering until your thighs are parallel to the ground or as far as you can comfortably go.
5. Pause for a moment, then push through your heels to return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hold a vertical post or rack for balance and lean your torso back as your knees travel forward to maximize quad stretch.
- Keep your hips extended and your body in a straight line from knees to shoulders throughout the descent.
- Rise up by driving through the balls of your feet and squeezing your quads hard at the top.

## Common mistakes

- Breaking at the hips and bending forward, which turns this into a regular squat and removes the quad isolation.
- Dropping too fast into the bottom position, which puts excessive strain on the knee tendons.
- Going too deep too soon before building adequate quad strength and knee resilience.
