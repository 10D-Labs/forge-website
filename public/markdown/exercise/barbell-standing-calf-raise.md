## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and place a barbell across your upper back.
2. Raise your heels off the ground as high as possible, using only your toes.
3. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your heels back down to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Stand on a raised surface like a plate or block to increase the range of motion and get a full calf stretch at the bottom.
- Rise all the way up on your toes and squeeze hard at the top for 1-2 seconds before lowering.
- Keep the barbell stable across your upper traps (not your neck) and your core braced throughout.

## Common mistakes

- Bouncing at the bottom of the movement instead of using a controlled stretch and contraction.
- Bending the knees during the calf raise, which recruits the quads and reduces calf isolation.
- Placing the barbell on the neck instead of across the upper traps, which is uncomfortable and unsafe.
