2. Hold the band with both hands, palms facing your body, and keep your arms straight.
3. Engage your core and maintain a slight bend in your knees.
4. Slowly hinge forward at your hips, keeping your back straight and chest lifted.
5. Lower the band towards the ground while keeping your legs straight.
6. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then squeeze your glutes and hamstrings to return to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Maintain a neutral spine throughout and hinge exclusively at the hips, not the lower back.
- Keep the band close to your shins as you lower to minimize the forward moment arm on the spine.
- Squeeze the glutes forcefully at the top to achieve full hip extension.

## Common mistakes

- Rounding the upper and lower back, especially as fatigue sets in during later reps.
- Looking up during the hinge, which hyperextends the cervical spine. Keep your neck neutral.
- Locking the knees completely straight, which can hyperextend them. Maintain a micro-bend.
