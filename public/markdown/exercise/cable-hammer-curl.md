## How to perform

1. Stand upright with your feet shoulder-width apart and a slight bend in your knees.
2. Hold the cable rope attachment with an underhand grip, palms facing each other, and your arms fully extended.
3. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps.
4. Continue to raise the cable rope attachment until your biceps are fully contracted and the rope is at shoulder level.
5. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
6. Inhale and slowly begin to lower the cable rope attachment back to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use a rope attachment and keep your palms facing each other (neutral grip) throughout the entire curl to maximize brachioradialis and brachialis activation.
- At the top of the curl, spread the rope ends apart to intensify the bicep and forearm contraction.
- Pin your elbows to your sides and keep your upper arms completely vertical. Any forward drift turns this into a front raise.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the elbows drift forward as you curl, which uses the front delts to assist and reduces bicep tension.
- Rotating the wrists during the curl so palms face upward, which turns this into a standard curl and defeats the purpose of the hammer grip.
- Using excessive weight and swinging the body to complete reps.

## FAQ

### What is the difference between a Cable Hammer Curl and a regular Cable Curl?

The hammer curl uses a neutral grip (palms facing each other) which targets the brachialis and brachioradialis more heavily, building forearm thickness and the outer bicep. Regular curls with a supinated grip emphasize the bicep peak.

### What attachment should I use for Cable Hammer Curls?

A rope attachment is ideal because it naturally positions your hands in a neutral grip and allows you to spread the ends at the top for a stronger contraction.

### What muscles does the Cable Hammer Curl work?

The Cable Hammer Curl primarily targets the biceps, with secondary activation in the forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.

### Is the Cable Hammer Curl good for beginners?

Yes, the Cable Hammer Curl is rated as a beginner-level exercise. It's a great starting point for building biceps strength.
