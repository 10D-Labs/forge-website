## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a barbell across your upper back.
2. Take a big step to the side with your right foot, keeping your left foot planted.
3. Bend your right knee and lower your body down into a lunge position, keeping your left leg straight.
4. Push off with your right foot and return to the starting position.
5. Repeat on the other side, stepping with your left foot.

## Pro tips

- Take a wide step to the side and sit back into the lunging hip while keeping the trailing leg completely straight.
- Keep the barbell stable across your upper back and resist the urge to lean your torso excessively forward.
- Push off the lunging foot powerfully through the heel to return to the starting position.

## Common mistakes

- Not stepping wide enough, which limits the adductor stretch and reduces glute activation.
- Letting the lunging knee cave inward instead of tracking over the toes.
- Leaning the torso too far forward, which shifts the load from the glutes to the lower back.
