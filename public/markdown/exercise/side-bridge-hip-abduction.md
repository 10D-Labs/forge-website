## How to perform

1. Lie on your side with your legs extended and stacked on top of each other.
2. Prop yourself up on your forearm, keeping your elbow directly below your shoulder.
3. Engage your core and lift your hips off the ground, creating a straight line from your head to your feet.
4. While keeping your core engaged, lift your top leg as high as possible without rotating your hips.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then lower your leg back down.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch sides.

## Pro tips

- Stack your hips vertically and avoid letting the top hip roll forward or backward during the leg lift.
- Squeeze your bottom-side obliques hard to keep your hips elevated while you lift the top leg.
- Lift your top leg only as high as you can without your hip dropping or rotating; quality beats height.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the hips sag toward the floor, which puts stress on the lower back instead of working the abductors and obliques.
- Rotating the top leg outward during the lift, which recruits the hip flexors instead of isolating the abductors.
- Holding breath throughout the hold, which increases intra-abdominal pressure unnecessarily and limits endurance.
