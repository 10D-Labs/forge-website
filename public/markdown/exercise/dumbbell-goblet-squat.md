- Push your knees out over your toes and sit between your hips, using the dumbbell as a counterbalance.
- Keep the dumbbell tight against your chest throughout; don't let it drift forward.

- Letting the dumbbell pull forward and away from the chest, which rounds the upper back.
- Not squatting deep enough; the goblet squat is designed for full-depth squatting to maximize glute engagement.
- Placing the feet too narrow, which limits hip mobility and depth.
