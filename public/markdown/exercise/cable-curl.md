## How to perform

1. Stand facing the cable machine with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Grasp the cable attachment with an underhand grip, palms facing up.
3. Keep your elbows close to your sides and your upper arms stationary.
4. Exhale and curl the cable attachment towards your shoulders, contracting your biceps.
5. Pause for a moment at the top of the movement, squeezing your biceps.
6. Inhale and slowly lower the cable attachment back to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Stand about a foot away from the pulley and keep your elbows pinned at your sides throughout the entire movement.
- Use a straight bar or EZ bar attachment for bilateral work, or a single handle for unilateral focus.
- Squeeze the biceps hard at the top and lower the weight under control for a 2-3 second eccentric.

## Common mistakes

- Standing too close to the cable, which reduces tension at the top of the curl.
- Letting the elbows drift forward as you curl, which recruits the front delts and reduces bicep isolation.
- Using body English to swing the weight up instead of strict curling with the biceps.
