## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and grasp the cable handle with one hand.
2. Keep your back straight and your core engaged.
3. Slowly bend sideways at the waist, lowering the cable handle towards your knee.
4. Pause for a moment, then return to the starting position.
5. Repeat on the other side.
6. Alternate sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hold the cable in one hand and bend directly to the side away from the machine, then control the return. The obliques on the side away from the cable are doing the work.
- Keep your hips stationary and bend only at the waist. If your hips shift, you are compensating with your lower back.
- Perform all reps on one side before switching. Do not alternate sides each rep since this reduces time under tension for each oblique.

## Common mistakes

- Bending forward instead of directly to the side, which recruits the abs and hip flexors instead of the obliques.
- Rotating the torso during the bend, which turns this into a twist rather than a pure lateral flexion movement.
- Using too much weight, which limits the range of motion and prevents full oblique contraction.

## FAQ

### Do Cable Side Bends make your waist wider?

Heavy oblique training can add thickness to the waist over time. If a narrow waist is your goal, use lighter weight and higher reps, or prioritize other core exercises like planks and anti-rotation movements.

### How do I feel Cable Side Bends in my obliques instead of my back?

Focus on bending strictly to the side without any forward or backward lean. Place your free hand on your oblique to feel the contraction. If your back hurts, you are likely rotating or hyperextending.
