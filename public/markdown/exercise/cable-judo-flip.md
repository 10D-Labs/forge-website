## How to perform

1. Stand facing the cable machine with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Hold the cable handle with both hands at chest level, palms facing down.
3. Engage your core and rotate your torso to the right, pulling the cable across your body.
4. As you rotate, pivot your back foot and allow your hips to rotate naturally.
5. Extend your arms fully and finish the movement by flipping the cable handle over your shoulder.
6. Return to the starting position by reversing the movement, rotating your torso back to the center.
7. Repeat the movement on the opposite side.
8. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Generate the rotation from your core and hips, not your arms. Your arms are just transmitting the force your trunk creates.
- Pivot your back foot as you rotate to allow full hip turnover and protect your knees from twisting forces.
- Start with light weight to master the rotational pattern before adding load. This is a power movement that requires coordination.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling with the arms instead of rotating through the core, which turns this into a cable row and misses the abs entirely.
- Keeping the feet planted flat and not pivoting, which limits rotational range and puts stress on the lower back and knees.
- Moving too fast without control, losing the mind-muscle connection with the obliques and core.
