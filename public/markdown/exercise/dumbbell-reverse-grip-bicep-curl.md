## How to perform

2. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps.
3. Continue to raise the weights until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level.
4. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
5. Inhale and slowly begin to lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your palms facing down (overhand grip) throughout the entire curl to target the brachioradialis and forearm extensors.
- Use a lighter weight than standard curls since the reverse grip puts the biceps in a weaker position and relies more on the brachioradialis.
- Keep your wrists straight and rigid throughout to avoid wrist strain under the reverse grip load.

## Common mistakes

- Rotating the wrists to a palms-up position during the curl, which turns this into a regular Bicep Curl.
- Using the same heavy weight as standard curls, leading to poor form and potential wrist strain.
- Bending the wrists backward during the curl, which puts excessive stress on the wrist extensors.
