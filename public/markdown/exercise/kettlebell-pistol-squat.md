## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a kettlebell in front of your chest with both hands.
2. Lift your left foot off the ground and extend it forward, keeping it parallel to the ground.
3. Slowly lower your body down into a squat position, keeping your right foot flat on the ground and your left leg extended.
4. Pause for a moment at the bottom of the squat, then push through your right heel to return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch legs.

## Pro tips

- Hold the kettlebell at chest height as a counterbalance. The weight in front of you actually makes the Pistol Squat easier by shifting your center of gravity forward.
- Actively push your non-working leg forward and flex the foot to keep it off the ground throughout the descent.
- Sit back and down slowly, keeping your heel planted on the working leg. Use a 3-4 second descent.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the heel of the working leg lift off the ground, which indicates insufficient ankle mobility.
- Allowing the non-working leg to touch the ground at the bottom, reducing the single-leg demand.
- Collapsing forward at the bottom instead of keeping the chest up and core braced.
