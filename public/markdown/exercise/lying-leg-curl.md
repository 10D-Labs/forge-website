5. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your hamstrings.
6. Inhale and slowly lower The back to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Position the pad just above your heels (on the Achilles tendon area), not on your calves, for optimal leverage.
- Curl the weight all the way up until your heels nearly touch your glutes, then lower slowly.
- Keep your hips pressed firmly into the pad. If they rise, the weight is too heavy.

- Lifting the hips off the bench during the curl, which uses the lower back instead of isolating the hamstrings.
- Not going through the full range of motion, especially at the top where the hamstrings contract the hardest.
- Letting the weight drop quickly on the eccentric phase instead of controlling the descent.
