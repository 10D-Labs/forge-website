## How to perform

1. Adjust the bench to a 30-45 degree incline.
2. Sit on the bench with your back flat against the pad and feet firmly on the ground.
3. Grasp the barbell with an overhand grip slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
4. Unrack the barbell and lower it slowly towards your upper chest, keeping your elbows slightly tucked in.
5. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push the barbell back up to the starting position, fully extending your arms.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Set the incline to 30-45 degrees; steeper angles shift too much work to the front delts.
- Position the bench so the bar lowers to your upper chest, just below the collarbone.
- Drive the bar up and slightly back so it finishes over your upper chest, not your face.

## Common mistakes

- Setting the incline too steep (60+ degrees), which turns it into an overhead press rather than a chest exercise.
- Positioning the bench incorrectly so the bar path doesn't align with the upper chest.
- Arching the back excessively, which flattens the incline angle and defeats the purpose of the exercise.
