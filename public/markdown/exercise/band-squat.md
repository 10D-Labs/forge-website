## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, with the band placed just above your knees.
2. Keeping your chest up and core engaged, push your hips back and bend your knees to lower into a squat position.
3. Make sure your knees are tracking over your toes and your weight is in your heels.
4. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push through your heels to return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Place the band just above your knees and push your knees outward against it throughout the entire squat.
- Sit back and down as if sitting into a chair, keeping your chest lifted and weight in your heels.
- Squeeze your glutes hard at the top and maintain outward knee pressure against the band.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the knees cave inward against the band pressure, which defeats the purpose of the exercise.
- Leaning too far forward at the bottom, shifting weight onto the toes.
- Not squatting deep enough to break parallel, limiting glute activation.

## FAQ

### What does the band above the knees do during squats?

It forces the hip abductors (especially glute medius) to fire constantly to push the knees out. This improves knee tracking and glute activation.

### Should you use a band for every squat session?

Not necessarily. Use it as a warmup activation tool or for technique work. For heavy strength training, the band can be a distraction from the primary movement.

### What band thickness is best for banded squats?

A light mini band is sufficient. The goal is glute activation and knee tracking, not added resistance to the squat itself.

### What muscles does the Band Squat work?

The Band Squat primarily targets the glutes, with secondary activation in the quadriceps, hamstrings, calves. It's classified as a strength exercise for the legs.

### Is the Band Squat good for beginners?

Yes, the Band Squat is rated as a beginner-level exercise. It's a great starting point for building glutes strength.
