## How to perform

1. Lie flat on a bench with your feet flat on the ground and your back pressed against the bench.
2. Grasp the band handles with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3. Extend your arms fully, pushing the bands away from your chest.
4. Slowly lower the bands back down to your chest, keeping your elbows at a 90 degree angle.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Loop the band around your upper back and hold the ends in your hands, pressing from chest level to full arm extension.
- The band provides increasing resistance as you press, so focus on an explosive press through the sticking point.
- Keep your shoulder blades retracted and pressed into the bench throughout the movement.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the band slide off the upper back during the press, which removes the added resistance.
- Flaring the elbows out to 90 degrees, which increases shoulder impingement risk.
- Not controlling the eccentric, letting the band snap the bar back to the chest too quickly.
