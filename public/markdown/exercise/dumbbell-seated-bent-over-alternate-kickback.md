## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing inwards.
2. Bend forward at the waist, keeping your back straight and parallel to the ground.
3. Extend one arm straight back, keeping it close to your body, until your arm is fully extended.
4. Pause for a moment, then slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position.
5. Repeat with the other arm.
6. Continue alternating arms for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Bend forward at the waist until your torso is nearly parallel to the ground for the best angle of resistance.
- Extend one arm at a time fully back until your arm is straight and parallel to the ground.
- Pause at full extension and squeeze the tricep for a one-count before lowering.

## Common mistakes

- Not bending forward enough, which reduces the resistance on the tricep by changing the gravity angle.
- Swinging the dumbbells rather than extending them with controlled tricep contraction.
- Letting the upper arms drop from the parallel position, which shortens the range of motion.
