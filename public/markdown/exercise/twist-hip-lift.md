## How to perform

1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground.
2. Place your hands by your sides for support.
3. Engage your glutes and lift your hips off the ground, forming a straight line from your knees to your shoulders.
4. While keeping your hips lifted, twist your lower body to the right side, bringing your knees towards the ground.
5. Return to the starting position and repeat the twist to the left side.
6. Continue alternating twists for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Squeeze your glutes at the top of each lift before initiating the twist to ensure you're activating the right muscles.
- Control the twist slowly rather than flopping your knees to the side; the obliques should work throughout the rotation.
- Keep your shoulders and upper back pinned to the ground as your lower body rotates.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the hips drop during the twist, which removes tension from the glutes and obliques.
- Using momentum to swing the knees from side to side rather than controlling the rotation with your core.
- Not lifting the hips high enough before twisting, which limits glute activation.
