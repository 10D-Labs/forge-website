## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a kettlebell in front of your thighs with both hands, palms facing towards you.
2. Bend your knees slightly and hinge at the hips, lowering the kettlebell towards the ground.
3. Explosively extend your hips and knees, using the momentum to pull the kettlebell up towards your shoulders.
4. As the kettlebell reaches shoulder height, rotate your wrists and catch the kettlebell in the rack position, with your elbows tucked in and the kettlebell resting on the back of your forearm.
5. Lower the kettlebell back down to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hinge at the hips and use a powerful hip snap to drive both kettlebells to the rack position simultaneously.
- Keep the bells close to your body on the way up. The path should be vertical, not a wide arc.
- Absorb the catch with a slight knee dip and tight elbows to prevent the bells from crashing into your forearms.

## Common mistakes

- Using the arms to curl the kettlebells up instead of relying on hip power.
- Catching the kettlebells with the elbows wide, which destabilizes the rack position and stresses the shoulders.
- Not timing the hip snap properly, resulting in the bells being pulled up at different heights.
