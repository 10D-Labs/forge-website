## How to perform

1. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Take a step forward with your right foot, lowering your body into a lunge position.
3. Push off with your right foot and jump into the air, switching the position of your feet mid-air.
4. Land softly with your left foot forward and immediately lower your body into a lunge position.
5. Continue alternating between lunges and jumps for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Land softly on the balls of your feet and immediately sink into the lunge to absorb impact through your muscles, not joints.
- Swing your arms upward as you jump to generate extra height and allow time for the leg switch.
- Keep your front knee aligned over your ankle on every landing; don't let it shoot past your toes.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning the torso too far forward on the landing, which puts excessive stress on the front knee.
- Not switching legs fully in the air, landing with feet too close together and losing balance.
- Taking too shallow a stance on the landing, which forces the front knee past the toes.
