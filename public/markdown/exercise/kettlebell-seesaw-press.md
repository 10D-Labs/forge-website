## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a kettlebell in each hand at shoulder height.
2. Press one kettlebell overhead while keeping the other kettlebell at shoulder height.
3. Lower the pressed kettlebell back to shoulder height while simultaneously pressing the other kettlebell overhead.
4. Continue alternating the pressing motion, creating a seesaw-like movement.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- As one bell goes up, the other comes down simultaneously in a smooth, rhythmic alternating pattern.
- Keep your core braced throughout the alternating motion, as the shifting load creates a rotational challenge.
- Press in a slight arc, not straight up. Each bell should finish directly over the pressing shoulder.

## Common mistakes

- Waiting for one bell to fully descend before pressing the other, which turns it into a standard alternating press instead of a seesaw.
- Letting the torso sway side to side with each press rather than keeping the trunk rigid.
- Pressing too fast and losing control of the bells at the top.

The Kettlebell Seesaw Press primarily targets the shoulders, with secondary activation in the triceps, core. It's classified as a strength exercise for the shoulders.
