1. Start in a pushup position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and your feet together.
2. Lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows, keeping your back straight and your core engaged.
3. As you push back up, lift one leg off the ground and kick it out to the side, keeping it straight.
4. Lower your leg back down and repeat the pushup, then switch to the other leg.
5. Continue alternating leg kicks with each pushup repetition.
