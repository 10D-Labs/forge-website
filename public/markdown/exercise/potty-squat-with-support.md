## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointing slightly outward.
2. Hold onto a stable support, such as a chair or wall, for balance.
3. Lower your body down into a squat position by bending your knees and pushing your hips back.
4. Keep your chest up and your back straight throughout the movement.
5. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push through your heels to return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hold the support lightly for balance, not to pull yourself up. Your legs should do all the work.
- Sit as deep as your mobility allows, working to increase depth over time.
- Focus on keeping your heels on the ground and your knees tracking over your toes.

## Common mistakes

- Relying too heavily on the support to pull yourself up, which removes the leg strengthening benefit.
- Leaning forward excessively instead of sitting straight down between the feet.
- Losing heel contact with the floor, which indicates tight ankles that need mobility work.
