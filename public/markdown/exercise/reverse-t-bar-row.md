## How to perform

2. Sit on the machine with your chest against the pad and your feet flat on the footplate.
3. Grasp the handles with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
4. Keep your back straight and engage your core.
5. Pull the handles towards your chest, squeezing your shoulder blades together.
6. Pause for a moment at the top of the movement, then slowly release and extend your arms back to the starting position.

## Pro tips

- Press your chest firmly into the pad throughout the movement to isolate the back and prevent cheating.
- Pull with your elbows and focus on pinching your shoulder blades together rather than just bending your arms.
- Use a controlled 2-second eccentric on each rep to build more back thickness.

## Common mistakes

- Lifting the chest off the pad to use momentum, defeating the isolation purpose of the machine.
- Pulling the handles too high toward the neck instead of the lower chest, which overloads the traps.
- Gripping the handles too tightly, which pre-fatigues the forearms before the back is adequately worked.
