## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with your feet flat on the ground and hold a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing up.
2. Keep your back straight and your elbows close to your torso.
3. Exhale and curl the dumbbells up towards your shoulders, contracting your biceps.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Sit with your back against the bench pad to prevent using momentum, making every rep strict.
- Supinate your wrists as you curl (turn pinky outward) for maximum bicep brachii activation.
- Lower the dumbbells under control for a full 3-second eccentric on every rep.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning forward off the bench to generate momentum on heavier reps.
- Curling both dumbbells simultaneously, which can cause you to arch your back; alternating may be safer for some.
- Not extending the arms fully at the bottom, which limits the stretch and reduces effective range of motion.

## FAQ

### Is the seated Bicep Curl better than standing curls?

### Should I use a bench with back support?

Yes, leaning against a back pad eliminates the temptation to lean back and cheat. An upright bench or adjustable bench at 90 degrees works best.

### How many reps are best for seated curls?

Eight to twelve reps per set is the sweet spot for hypertrophy. Since the movement is strict, the biceps will fatigue quickly, so moderate weight with good form is key.

The Dumbbell Seated Bicep Curl primarily targets the biceps, with secondary activation in the forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.
