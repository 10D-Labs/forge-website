## How to perform

2. Rest your elbow on the inside of your thigh, just above the knee.
3. Curl the barbell up towards your shoulder while keeping your upper arm stationary.
4. Squeeze your biceps at the top of the movement, then slowly lower the barbell back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Rest both elbows against the insides of your thighs to create a solid pivot point and prevent cheating.
- Use the inner narrow grips of the EZ bar and curl the weight slowly to your shoulders.
- Squeeze the biceps hard at the top for a 2-second hold before lowering.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the elbows slide off the thighs during the curl, which allows the shoulders to assist.
- Rounding the back and hunching forward, which can strain the lower back.
- Using too much weight for the concentration position, which forces compensatory body movement.
