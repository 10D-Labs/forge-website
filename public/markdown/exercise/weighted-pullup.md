2. Hang from the bar with your arms fully extended and your body straight.
3. Engage your back muscles and pull your body up towards the bar, keeping your elbows close to your body.
4. Continue pulling until your chin is above the bar.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your body back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

- Use a dip belt for adding weight rather than holding a dumbbell between your feet, which limits loading.
- Initiate the pull by depressing and retracting your shoulder blades before bending your elbows.

- Kipping or using momentum to get the chin over the bar, which defeats the purpose of Weighted Pullups.
- Adding too much weight too soon, which causes form breakdown and limits range of motion.
- Not fully extending at the bottom, performing partial reps that shortchange lat development.
