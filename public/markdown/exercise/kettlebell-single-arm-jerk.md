## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a kettlebell in one hand at shoulder height.
2. Bend your knees slightly and engage your core.
3. Press the kettlebell overhead in a straight line, fully extending your arm.
4. As you press the kettlebell overhead, simultaneously dip your knees and quickly straighten them to generate momentum.
5. As the kettlebell reaches its highest point, quickly drop underneath it by bending your knees and hips.
6. Catch the kettlebell with a slight bend in your knees and hips, and your arm fully extended overhead.
7. Stand up straight, fully extending your knees and hips, and stabilize the kettlebell overhead.
8. Lower the kettlebell back to the starting position by bending your knees and hips, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- The dip should be quick and shallow (4-6 inches). Think of it as a speed dip, not a squat.
- Catch the weight overhead with a slight knee bend to absorb the force, then stand tall to complete the lockout.
- Keep the non-working arm out to the side for balance, not hanging by your side.

## Common mistakes

- Dipping too slowly, which loses the stretch-shortening cycle that makes the jerk powerful.
- Pressing instead of jerking. If your arm is doing most of the work, you're not using enough leg drive.
- Not catching the bell with a quick second dip under it, which is what distinguishes a jerk from a push press.
