## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold the band in front of your thighs with your palms facing inwards.
2. Keep your arms straight and lift them up and out to the sides, forming a 'Y' shape with your body.
3. Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.
4. Slowly lower your arms back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Raise your arms in a Y shape (about 30 degrees from vertical) to target the lower traps and posterior delts.
- Keep a slight bend in the elbows and lead with the thumbs pointing upward.
- Squeeze the shoulder blades together at the top of the Y position for a one-second hold.

## Common mistakes

- Raising the arms straight out to the side (T shape) instead of angled forward in a Y, which shifts the emphasis away from the lower traps.
- Shrugging the shoulders up instead of keeping them depressed and retracted throughout.
- Using a band that is too thick, which prevents achieving full range of motion overhead.
