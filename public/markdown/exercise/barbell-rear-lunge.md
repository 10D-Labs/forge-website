## How to perform

1. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and a barbell resting on your upper back.
2. Take a step backward with your right foot, landing on the ball of your foot.
3. Bend both knees to lower your body until your left thigh is parallel to the ground.
4. Push through your left heel to return to the starting position.
5. Repeat with the other leg.

## Pro tips

- Step far enough back that your front shin stays vertical when you drop into the lunge.
- Lower your back knee toward the ground in a straight line rather than letting it drift forward or to the side.
- Push through the heel of your front foot to return to standing, squeezing the glute at the top.

## Common mistakes

- Not stepping far enough back, which causes the front knee to push past the toes and overloads the knee joint.
- Leaning the torso forward with the barbell on your back, which stresses the lower back.
- Losing balance by placing the back foot directly behind the front foot instead of maintaining a hip-width base.

## FAQ

### Are rear lunges better than Forward Lunges?

Rear lunges are generally easier on the knees because the front shin stays more vertical and there's less deceleration force. They're a better option if you have knee sensitivity.

### Should I alternate legs or do all reps on one side?

Both work. Alternating keeps the workout balanced and mimics walking patterns. Doing all reps on one side increases fatigue for that leg and builds more muscular endurance.

### Where should I feel rear lunges the most?

Primarily in the glute and quad of the front (stationary) leg. If you feel it mostly in the back leg, you're probably pushing off with the back foot instead of driving through the front heel.

### What muscles does the Barbell Rear Lunge work?

The Barbell Rear Lunge primarily targets the glutes, with secondary activation in the quadriceps, hamstrings, calves. It's classified as a strength exercise for the legs.

### Is the Barbell Rear Lunge good for beginners?

The Barbell Rear Lunge is rated as intermediate. Beginners should build a base of glutes strength with easier variations first.
