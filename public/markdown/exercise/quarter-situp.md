## How to perform

1. Lie flat on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground.
2. Place your hands behind your head with your elbows pointing outwards.
3. Engaging your abs, slowly lift your upper body off the ground, curling forward until your torso is at a 45 degree angle.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your upper body back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lift only your shoulder blades off the floor; your lower back should remain in contact with the ground throughout.
- Place your hands lightly behind your head or crossed on your chest to avoid pulling on the neck.
- Focus on a hard exhale and ab squeeze at the top of the small range of motion.

## Common mistakes

- Curling up too far, turning it into a half or full sit-up, which defeats the purpose of the quarter range.
- Pulling on the neck with the hands to lift higher, straining the cervical spine.
- Using momentum to bounce through reps instead of controlled, deliberate contractions.
