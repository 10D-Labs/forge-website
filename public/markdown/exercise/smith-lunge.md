## How to perform

1. Set up the smith machine with the barbell at hip height.
2. Stand facing away from the machine with your feet shoulder-width apart.
3. Step back with your right foot and place it on the barbell, resting the top of your foot on the bar.
4. Bend your left knee and lower your body into a lunge position, keeping your back straight.
5. Push through your left heel to return to the starting position.
6. Repeat on the other side, stepping back with your left foot.
7. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Take a long enough step that both knees form approximately 90-degree angles at the bottom position.
- Keep the bar positioned on your upper traps, not on your neck, and maintain an upright torso.
- Push through the front heel to return to the starting position, engaging the glutes.

## Common mistakes

- Taking too short a step, which puts excessive forward pressure on the front knee.
- Letting the front knee collapse inward instead of tracking over the second and third toes.
- Leaning the torso forward excessively, which loads the lower back instead of the legs.

## FAQ

### Is the Smith machine lunge safe for knees?

Lower until your back knee nearly touches the floor and your front thigh is parallel to the ground. Both knees should be at approximately 90 degrees.
