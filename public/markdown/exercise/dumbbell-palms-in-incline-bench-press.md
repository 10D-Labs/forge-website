- Lower the dumbbells until they're alongside your ribcage, elbows tucked at about 30-45 degrees from your torso.
- Press the dumbbells straight up and slightly inward, bringing them close together at the top for a stronger tricep contraction.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the wrists rotate outward at the top of the press, which changes the muscle emphasis to the chest.
