## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with your feet flat on the floor and hold a barbell with an underhand grip, hands shoulder-width apart.
2. Rest your upper arms against your inner thighs, just above your knees, and let the barbell hang down in front of you.
3. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the barbell up towards your shoulders, contracting your biceps.
4. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause, then inhale and slowly lower the barbell back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Press the backs of your upper arms firmly into your inner thighs to lock them in place and eliminate swinging.
- Use a close grip (hands 6-8 inches apart) and curl the bar up to your chin level, squeezing the biceps hard at the peak.
- Lower the bar under full control for 3 seconds to maximize the eccentric stimulus on the biceps.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the upper arms lift off the thighs to cheat the bar up, which defeats the concentration curl benefit.
- Leaning back at the top of the curl to create momentum instead of staying hunched forward.
- Using too wide a grip, which reduces the peak contraction of the biceps.

## FAQ

### What's the advantage of the seated concentration curl over standing curls?

The thigh brace locks your upper arms in place, making it impossible to cheat. This forces stricter bicep isolation and a stronger mind-muscle connection than standing curls.

### Should I use a close grip or regular grip?

Close grip (hands about 6 inches apart) emphasizes the outer (long) head of the biceps more, which contributes to the bicep peak. This is the intended grip for this variation.

### How heavy should I go?

Light to moderate. Use about 60-70% of your regular Barbell Curl weight. The strict positioning means less weight provides the same or better stimulus.

### What muscles does the Barbell Seated Close Grip Concentration Curl work?

The Barbell Seated Close Grip Concentration Curl primarily targets the biceps, with secondary activation in the forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.

### Is the Barbell Seated Close Grip Concentration Curl good for beginners?

The Barbell Seated Close Grip Concentration Curl is rated as intermediate. Beginners should build a base of biceps strength with easier variations first.
