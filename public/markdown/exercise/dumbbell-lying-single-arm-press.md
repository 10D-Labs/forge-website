## Pro tips

- Brace your core hard and press your non-working hand into the bench or your hip to prevent your torso from rotating during the press.
- Focus on pressing straight up over the shoulder, not drifting the dumbbell toward the center of your chest.
- Start with your weaker arm first each set to ensure balanced development.

## Common mistakes

- Rotating the torso toward the pressing side, which turns this into a partial twist press instead of a strict unilateral Chest Press.
- Neglecting core bracing, causing the body to roll toward the non-working side and compromising form.
- Using the same weight as a bilateral press; you should use slightly less since stabilization demands are higher.
