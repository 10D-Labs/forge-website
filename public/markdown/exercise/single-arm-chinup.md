## How to perform

1. Stand facing a pullup bar with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Reach up and grab the bar with an underhand grip, with one hand gripping the bar and the other hand holding your wrist for support.
3. Hang from the bar with your arm fully extended, keeping your body straight and your core engaged.
4. Pull yourself up towards the bar by bending your elbow and squeezing your back muscles.
5. Continue pulling until your chin is above the bar, then slowly lower yourself back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch arms and repeat.

## Pro tips

- Start with assisted versions (one hand gripping the wrist of the working arm) before attempting a full Single Arm Chinup.
- Engage your lat fully by depressing your shoulder before initiating the pull.
- Keep your body tight and avoid excessive swinging; a slight rotation toward the working arm is normal.

- Attempting the movement without adequate baseline strength (you should be able to do 15+ strict Chinups first).
- Kipping excessively instead of pulling with controlled strength.
- Neglecting to warm up the elbow and shoulder joints, which are under extreme stress during this exercise.
