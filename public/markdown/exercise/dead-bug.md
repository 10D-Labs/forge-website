## How to perform

1. Lie flat on your back with your arms extended towards the ceiling.
2. Bend your knees and lift your legs off the ground, creating a 90 degree angle at your hips and knees.
3. Engage your core and lower back to press your lower back into the ground.
4. Slowly lower your right arm and left leg towards the ground, keeping them straight and hovering just above the floor.
5. Pause for a moment, then return to the starting position.
6. Repeat the movement with your left arm and right leg.
7. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Press your lower back hard into the floor and do not let it arch at any point during the movement. This is the single most important cue for Dead Bugs.
- Move slowly, taking 3 seconds to lower each arm and leg, and 3 seconds to return. Speed defeats the purpose of this exercise.
- Exhale as you extend the opposite arm and leg, which helps brace the core and maintain the lower back position.

## Common mistakes

- Allowing the lower back to arch off the floor as you extend the arm and leg, which means your core has lost stability and the exercise is not working.
- Moving the arm and leg on the same side instead of opposite arm and leg, which reduces the anti-rotational challenge.
- Going too fast and losing the core bracing, which turns this into a coordination drill rather than a core stability exercise.
