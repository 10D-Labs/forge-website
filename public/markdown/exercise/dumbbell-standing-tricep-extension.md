## How to perform

2. Raise the dumbbell overhead, fully extending your arm.
3. Keep your upper arm close to your head and perpendicular to the ground.
4. Slowly lower the dumbbell behind your head, bending your elbow.
5. Pause for a moment, then raise the dumbbell back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hold one dumbbell overhead with a straight arm, then lower it behind your head by bending the elbow while keeping the upper arm vertical.
- Press the dumbbell back up by extending the elbow fully, squeezing the triceps at the top.
- Keep your core tight and avoid arching your back as the dumbbell moves behind your head.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the elbow flare out to the side instead of keeping it pointed straight up toward the ceiling.
- Arching the lower back to compensate for tight shoulders or heavy weight overhead.
- Moving the upper arm forward and backward during the extension, which involves the shoulder and reduces triceps isolation.
