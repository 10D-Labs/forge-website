## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Lower your body into a squat position by bending your knees and pushing your hips back.
3. Jump up explosively, extending your hips, knees, and ankles.
4. While in mid-air, quickly bring your feet together.
5. Land softly on the balls of your feet and immediately drop back into a squat position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Land softly on the balls of your feet and immediately absorb the impact by dropping into a deep squat.
- Start from a low box (6-12 inches) and only increase height as your landing mechanics improve.
- Explode upward out of the squat with maximum intent; the goal is to minimize ground contact time.

## Common mistakes

- Landing with stiff, locked-out legs instead of bending the knees to absorb the impact.
- Letting the knees collapse inward on the landing, which puts dangerous lateral stress on the knee joint.
- Starting from a surface that's too high before developing the landing strength and coordination required.
