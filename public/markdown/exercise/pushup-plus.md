## How to perform

1. Start in a high plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and your body in a straight line from head to heels.
2. Lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows, keeping them close to your sides.
3. Once your chest is just above the ground, push through your hands to extend your arms and lift your upper body up.
4. At the top of the movement, protract your shoulder blades by pushing your upper back towards the ceiling.
5. Pause for a moment, then reverse the movement by retracting your shoulder blades and lowering your body back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Perform a full Pushup, then at the top, push extra far so your upper back rounds and your shoulder blades protract fully.
- The 'plus' portion is the key; really push the floor away and feel your serratus anterior engage around your ribcage.
- Keep your core braced throughout so the extra push comes from protraction, not from piking the hips.

## Common mistakes

- Skipping the plus (protraction) at the top, which turns it into a regular Pushup and misses the serratus anterior work.
- Piking the hips during the plus phase instead of keeping the body straight and protracting only the shoulder blades.
- Not achieving full protraction because of rushing; hold the top position for 1-2 seconds to ensure full scapular spread.
