## How to Perform Pushup Plus

1. Start in a high plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and your body in a straight line from head to heels.
2. Lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows, keeping them close to your sides.
3. Once your chest is just above the ground, push through your hands to extend your arms and lift your upper body up.
4. At the top of the movement, protract your shoulder blades by pushing your upper back towards the ceiling.
5. Pause for a moment, then reverse the movement by retracting your shoulder blades and lowering your body back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
