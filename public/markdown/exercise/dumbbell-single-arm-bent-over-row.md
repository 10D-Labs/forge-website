## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in one hand with your palm facing your body.
2. Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight and your core engaged.
3. Let the dumbbell hang straight down towards the floor, with your arm fully extended.
4. Pull the dumbbell up towards your chest, keeping your elbow close to your body and squeezing your shoulder blades together.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbell back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch sides.

## Pro tips

- Place your non-working hand and knee on a bench for support, keeping your back flat and parallel to the floor.
- Pull the dumbbell toward your lower rib cage, driving your elbow straight back. Your elbow should pass your torso at the top.
- Let the dumbbell hang at full arm extension at the bottom to get a deep lat stretch, then initiate the pull with the shoulder blade.

## Common mistakes

- Rotating the torso to heave the weight up, which uses momentum instead of back muscle contraction.
- Pulling the dumbbell toward the shoulder instead of the lower rib cage, which shifts emphasis to the rear delt and bicep.
- Rounding the back, especially at full arm extension, which puts the lumbar spine at risk.
