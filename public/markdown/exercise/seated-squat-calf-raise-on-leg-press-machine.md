## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat of the leg press machine so that your knees are slightly bent when your feet are on the footplate.
2. Sit on the machine with your back against the backrest and your feet flat on the footplate, shoulder-width apart.
3. Place your toes and the balls of your feet on the footplate, keeping your heels off the edge.
4. Release the safety handles and push the footplate away from you by extending your knees.
5. Once your knees are fully extended, slowly lower your heels by flexing your calves.
6. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push the footplate back up by extending your calves.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Position only the balls of your feet on the bottom edge of the footplate with your heels completely off.
- Extend your legs to nearly straight (slight bend) and then perform the calf raise by pressing through the toes.
- Control the eccentric by lowering your toes slowly for a full 2-3 seconds to maximize time under tension.

## Common mistakes

- Placing the entire foot on the plate, which turns it into a Leg Press rather than a calf raise.
- Letting the safety catches remain engaged, which limits range of motion at the bottom of the calf raise.
- Using too much weight and relying on a bouncing motion at the bottom instead of controlled contractions.
