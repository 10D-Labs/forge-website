## How to perform

1. Start in a pushup position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and your feet hip-width apart.
2. Lower your body towards the ground, bending your elbows and keeping your core engaged.
3. As you lower your body, shift your weight back and lift your hips up towards the ceiling, creating an inverted V shape with your body.
4. Continue to lower your body until your chest is just above the ground, then reverse the movement, pushing your hips back down and extending your arms to return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Flow through the movement smoothly: start in downward dog, swoop down and through, then press up into upward dog.
- Keep your hips high at the start and let them drop low at the end of the movement to get a full spinal extension.
- Use your chest and shoulders to drive the scooping motion, not just your arms.

## Common mistakes

- Skipping the scooping motion and just doing a regular Pushup, which misses the unique shoulder mobility and chest stretch benefit.
- Moving too fast through the transition phases, losing the stretch and strength benefits at each position.
- Letting the elbows flare wide during the swoop phase, which puts excessive stress on the shoulder joints.
