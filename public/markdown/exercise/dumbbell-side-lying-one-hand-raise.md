- Lie on your side with the working arm on top, starting with the dumbbell resting against your outer thigh and raising it to shoulder height.

- Using too heavy a weight and compensating with body rocking to lift the dumbbell.
- Raising the arm past shoulder height, which shifts tension to the traps.
