## How to perform

1. Stand or sit up straight with your shoulders relaxed.
2. Tilt your head to one side, bringing your ear towards your shoulder.
3. Hold the stretch for 15-30 seconds.
4. Repeat on the other side.
5. Perform 2-4 sets on each side.

## Pro tips

- Use the weight of your hand gently placed on the opposite side of your head to deepen the stretch, never pull forcefully.
- Keep the shoulder on the non-stretching side pulled down and away from the ear to increase the stretch intensity.
- Hold each side for at least 20 seconds and breathe steadily throughout.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling the head aggressively with the hand, which can strain the cervical spine muscles and ligaments.
- Letting the stretching-side shoulder ride up, which shortens the muscle and reduces the stretch.
- Rotating the head forward or backward instead of tilting purely to the side.
