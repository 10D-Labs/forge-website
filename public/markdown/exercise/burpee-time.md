## Pro tips

- Think of the Burpee as five distinct phases: squat down, kick back, Pushup, jump feet in, jump up.
- Keep your core braced throughout, especially during the kick-back and jump-in transitions.
- Land softly from each jump by bending your knees and absorbing force through your legs.

## Common mistakes

- Skipping the Pushup at the bottom or doing a half Pushup, which reduces the upper body training stimulus.
- Not fully extending at the top of the jump, cutting the range of motion short.
- Letting the hips sag during the plank/Pushup phase because of core fatigue.
