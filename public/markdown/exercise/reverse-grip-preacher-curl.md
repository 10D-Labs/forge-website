## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height and position yourself on the machine.
2. Grasp the handles with an underhand grip, palms facing up.
3. Rest your upper arms on the preacher pad, ensuring your elbows are fully extended.
4. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the handles towards your shoulders.
5. Pause for a moment at the top of the movement, squeezing your biceps.
6. Inhale and slowly lower the handles back to the starting position, fully extending your elbows.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your wrists straight throughout the movement; don't let them flex or extend under load.
- Press your upper arms firmly into the pad and resist the urge to lift your elbows as the weight gets heavy.
- Squeeze at the top for a full second before lowering to maximize the peak contraction.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the wrists bend backward under the weight, which strains the wrist joint and reduces bicep engagement.
- Using momentum to swing the handles up rather than curling with controlled bicep contraction.
- Not fully extending at the bottom of each rep, which limits the stretch and reduces muscle activation.

## FAQ

### Is the Reverse Grip Preacher Curl the same as a regular Preacher Curl?

The instructions describe an underhand (supinated) grip, which is the standard Preacher Curl grip. A true reverse grip would use an overhand (pronated) grip targeting the brachialis and forearms.

### Why use a machine instead of free weights for Preacher Curls?

The machine provides a consistent resistance curve throughout the range of motion and eliminates the need to balance the weight, allowing you to focus purely on contracting the biceps.

### Can Preacher Curls cause elbow pain?

Fully extending the elbow under load at the bottom can stress the joint. Keep a slight bend at the bottom of the rep and avoid slamming into lockout to protect your elbows.

### What muscles does the Reverse Grip Preacher Curl work?

The Reverse Grip Preacher Curl primarily targets the biceps, with secondary activation in the forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.
