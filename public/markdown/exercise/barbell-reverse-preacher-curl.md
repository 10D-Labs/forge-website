## How to perform

1. Sit on a preacher bench with your chest against the pad and your arms extended straight down, holding a barbell with an overhand grip.
2. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the barbell upward while contracting your biceps.
3. Continue to raise the barbell until your biceps are fully contracted and the barbell is at shoulder level.
4. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
5. Inhale and slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use an overhand grip on the preacher pad and curl with a controlled tempo; the pad eliminates all cheating.
- Don't fully extend at the bottom; maintain a slight bend to protect the elbow joint in the overhand position.
- Use significantly lighter weight than regular Preacher Curls since the reverse grip reduces mechanical advantage.

## Common mistakes

- Using the same weight as regular Preacher Curls, which forces terrible form and stresses the wrists.
- Hyperextending the elbows at the bottom of each rep, which is especially risky with the overhand grip.
- Lifting the elbows off the pad to cheat the bar up, defeating the purpose of the preacher bench.

## FAQ

### Why are reverse Preacher Curls so much harder than regular Preacher Curls?

The overhand grip puts the biceps in a mechanically weaker position and shifts work to the smaller brachioradialis and brachialis muscles. Expect to use 40-60% of your regular Preacher Curl weight.

### Who should do reverse Preacher Curls?

Anyone who wants thicker forearms, better grip strength, or more complete arm development. They're also useful for people with elbow tendinitis from too many supinated (palms-up) curl variations.

### How often should I train reverse Preacher Curls?

1-2 times per week, 3-4 sets of 10-15 reps. They work well at the end of an arm workout as a forearm finisher.

### What muscles does the Barbell Reverse Preacher Curl work?

The Barbell Reverse Preacher Curl primarily targets the biceps, with secondary activation in the forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.
