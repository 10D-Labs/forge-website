## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent.
2. Grasp the barbell with an overhand grip, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3. Keep your arms straight and your shoulders relaxed.
4. Lift your shoulders up towards your ears, squeezing your traps at the top.
5. Hold for a moment, then slowly lower your shoulders back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Shrug straight up toward your ears and squeeze the traps at the top for 2-3 seconds.
- Let the weight pull your shoulders down fully at the bottom for a complete stretch.
- Keep the bar close to your body and your arms completely straight throughout the movement.

## Common mistakes

- Rolling the shoulders in circles instead of shrugging straight up and down.
- Using too much weight with minimal range of motion; half-inch shrugs build nothing.
- Bending the elbows and using the biceps to help lift the weight.

## FAQ

### Are Smith machine shrugs better than free weight?

The fixed path lets you focus purely on trap contraction without worrying about the bar drifting. Free weights require more stabilization. Both are effective; use what lets you feel the traps working most.

Front shrugs hit the upper traps more directly. Behind-the-back shrugs engage the mid traps and retractors more. Do both for complete trap development.

### How many reps are best for Smith Shrugs?

Traps respond to both heavy weight/low reps (6-8) and moderate weight/high reps (15-20). Use heavy sets for strength and lighter sets with long holds at the top for hypertrophy.

### What muscles does the Smith Shrug work?

The Smith Shrug primarily targets the traps, with secondary activation in the shoulders. It's classified as a strength exercise for the back.
