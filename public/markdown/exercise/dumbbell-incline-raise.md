## How to perform

1. Sit on an incline bench with a dumbbell in each hand, resting on your thighs.
2. Lean back on the bench and raise the dumbbells to shoulder height, palms facing forward.
3. Keeping your back against the bench, exhale and raise the dumbbells above your head, fully extending your arms.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells back to shoulder height.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Press your back firmly into the incline bench to prevent arching and ensure the shoulders do the lifting, not momentum.
- Raise the dumbbells in a controlled arc, pausing briefly at the top to maximize shoulder engagement before lowering.
- Keep a slight bend in the elbows throughout to protect the joint while maintaining tension on the deltoids.

## Common mistakes

- Using too much weight and compensating by arching the back off the bench, which shifts load to the chest and spine.
- Locking out the elbows aggressively at the top, which transfers tension from the shoulders to the joints.
- Rushing through the lowering phase instead of controlling the eccentric, which wastes half the muscle-building stimulus.
