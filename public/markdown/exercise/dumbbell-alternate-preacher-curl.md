## How to perform

1. Sit on a preacher bench with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing up.
2. Rest your upper arms on the pad of the preacher bench, allowing your arms to fully extend.
3. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the dumbbell in your right hand as you contract your biceps.
4. Continue to curl the dumbbell until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbell is at shoulder level.
5. Pause for a moment, then inhale and slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position.
6. Repeat the movement with your left arm.
7. Continue alternating arms for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Lower each dumbbell slowly for a 3-second negative; the eccentric is where most muscle damage occurs for growth.
- Keep your chest pressed firmly against the pad and avoid lifting it between reps.
- Supinate fully at the top (pinky turned upward) and squeeze the bicep for a one-count.

## Common mistakes

- Using body momentum to swing each dumbbell up rather than curling with controlled bicep contraction.
- Not fully extending the arm at the bottom, which limits the stretch portion of the rep.
- Going too fast between alternating arms, which reduces time under tension and turns the exercise into cardio.

## FAQ

### Should I do all reps on one arm first or alternate each rep?

Alternating each rep is the standard approach. It gives each arm a brief rest between reps while keeping the set flowing. Doing all reps on one arm first is also valid for more intensity.

### How heavy should I go on Preacher Curls?

Use a weight where you can do 8-12 reps per arm with full range of motion and no body swing. The preacher pad exposes weakness, so expect to use less weight than standing curls.

### Are Preacher Curls safe for the elbows?

Yes, when done with a controlled tempo and you avoid slamming into full lockout at the bottom. Keep a slight bend in the elbow at the bottom of each rep to protect the joint.

### What muscles does the Dumbbell Alternate Preacher Curl work?

The Dumbbell Alternate Preacher Curl primarily targets the biceps, with secondary activation in the forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.

### Is the Dumbbell Alternate Preacher Curl good for beginners?

Yes, the Dumbbell Alternate Preacher Curl is rated as a beginner-level exercise. It's a great starting point for building biceps strength.
