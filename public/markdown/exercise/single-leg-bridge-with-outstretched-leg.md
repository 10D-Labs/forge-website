4. Hold for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your hips back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch legs.

## Pro tips

- Extend the non-working leg straight out and keep it elevated at hip height throughout the movement.
- Drive through the heel of the planted foot and squeeze the working glute hard at the top for 2 seconds.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the extended leg drop toward the ground, which reduces the hip flexor and core engagement.
- Pushing through the toes instead of the heel, shifting the work from glutes to quads.
- Rotating the hips as you bridge up instead of keeping them perfectly square.
