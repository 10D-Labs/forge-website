## How to perform

1. Attach the resistance band to a sturdy anchor point and secure it around your ankle.
2. Stand facing the anchor point with your feet shoulder-width apart.
3. Keeping your core engaged and your upper body stable, extend your leg straight out in front of you.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly return your leg to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch legs.

## Pro tips

- Anchor the band low and behind you so there is tension through the entire range of the extension.
- Extend your leg fully and squeeze the quad hard at the top for 1-2 seconds.
- Control the return and do not let the band pull your leg back too quickly.

## Common mistakes

- Not anchoring the band at the correct height, which changes the resistance curve and reduces quad activation.
- Leaning the torso to compensate for the resistance instead of keeping the upper body stable.
- Using a band that is too heavy, which limits the range of motion and prevents full knee extension.
