## How to perform

1. Lie on your back with your legs extended and your arms by your sides.
2. Loop the rope around the ball of your right foot and hold the ends of the rope with your hands.
3. Slowly raise your right leg towards your chest, keeping your knee straight and your foot flexed.
4. Hold the stretch for a few seconds, then slowly lower your leg back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat with your left leg.
6. Continue alternating legs for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep both hips flat on the ground; if one hip lifts, you've pulled the leg too far.
- Loop the rope around the ball of the foot, not the arch, to maintain a flexed foot position that stretches the entire posterior chain.
- Walk your hands closer along the rope to gradually increase the stretch as your flexibility improves during the hold.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling the leg too far and lifting the opposite hip off the ground, which rotates the pelvis and reduces the Hamstring Stretch.
- Tensing the shoulders and neck while pulling; keep your upper body relaxed on the floor.
- Holding your breath; breathe steadily and use each exhale to gently deepen the stretch.
