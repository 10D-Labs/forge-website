## How to perform

1. Sit on a preacher bench with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing your torso and arms fully extended.
2. Keep your upper arms stationary and exhale as you curl the weights while contracting your biceps.
3. Continue to raise the dumbbells until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level.
4. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
5. Inhale and slowly begin to lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Maintain the hammer (neutral) grip throughout; your palms should face each other, not rotate during the curl.
- Press your chest against the preacher pad to prevent your body from rocking as you alternate arms.
- Curl one arm at a time and fully complete the rep before starting the other arm to keep the tempo controlled.

## Common mistakes

- Rotating the wrist during the curl, changing it from a hammer curl to a standard curl mid-rep.
- Pulling the upper arm off the pad to help lift the weight, which removes the isolation benefit.
- Alternating too quickly without fully completing each rep, which shortens the range of motion.

## FAQ

### Why alternate arms on the preacher bench?

Alternating lets you focus on one arm at a time for better mind-muscle connection, and the brief rest between sides allows slightly more weight per arm.

The neutral grip targets the brachialis and brachioradialis more than a standard supinated curl, building arm thickness rather than peak.

### Can I use this to fix arm strength imbalances?

Yes, alternating single-arm work is one of the best ways to identify and correct imbalances. Start with your weaker arm and match the reps with the stronger arm.

The Dumbbell Alternate Hammer Preacher Curl primarily targets the biceps, with secondary activation in the forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.
