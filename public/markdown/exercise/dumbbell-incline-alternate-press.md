## How to perform

1. Sit on an incline bench with a dumbbell in each hand, resting on your thighs.
2. Lean back on the bench and use your thighs to help raise the dumbbells to shoulder height, palms facing forward.
3. Once at shoulder height, rotate your wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing forward.
4. Push the dumbbells up with your chest and shoulders, extending your arms fully.
5. Lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position, keeping your elbows slightly bent.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, alternating arms.

## Pro tips

- Keep the non-pressing arm at the top position (arm extended) while the other arm performs the press for added stabilization work.
- Press each dumbbell along an arc path, bringing them from shoulder width to touching at the top.
- Control the descent for 2 seconds on each arm to maximize time under tension.

## Common mistakes

- Lowering both dumbbells simultaneously instead of alternating, which defeats the unilateral stability benefit.
- Arching the lower back off the bench to assist the press instead of keeping the back flat.
- Turning the head to watch the pressing arm, which creates a neck strain risk.

## FAQ

### Why alternate instead of pressing both dumbbells at once?

Alternating forces each side to work independently while the non-pressing arm holds an isometric contraction. This builds core stability and exposes any strength imbalances between sides.

### What angle should the incline bench be at?

30-45 degrees is standard. A 30-degree angle targets more overall chest, while 45 degrees shifts emphasis toward the upper chest and front delts.

### How does this compare to a barbell incline press?

The dumbbell alternating version develops more stabilizer muscle activation and addresses imbalances. The barbell allows heavier loading for maximum strength.
