## How to perform

1. Adjust the machine to your desired weight and height settings.
2. Grasp the handles with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3. Hang with your arms fully extended and your feet off the ground.
4. Engage your back muscles and pull your body up towards the handles, keeping your elbows close to your body.
5. Continue pulling until your chin is above the handles.
6. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your body back down to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Start each rep from a dead hang with arms fully extended to build strength through the complete range of motion.
- Focus on pulling your elbows down and back rather than thinking about lifting your chin over the bar.
- Reduce the assistance weight by small increments (5-10 lbs) every 1-2 weeks to progressively build toward unassisted Pullups.

## Common mistakes

- Setting the counterweight too high, making the exercise so easy that you never build real pulling strength.
- Standing on the knee pad instead of kneeling, which changes the leverage and lets you push with your legs.
- Rushing through reps without pausing at the top or controlling the descent.

## FAQ

### How much assistance should I use on the Assisted Pullup machine?

Start with about 50-60% of your body weight as assistance. You should be able to complete 8-10 reps with good form but feel challenged on the last 2-3 reps.

### How long does it take to go from assisted to unassisted Pullups?

Most people can progress from assisted to their first unassisted Pullup in 4-12 weeks with consistent training 2-3 times per week, gradually reducing the assistance weight.

### Are resistance band Pullups better than the Assisted Pullup machine?

Bands provide more help at the bottom (where you're weakest) and less at the top. The machine provides constant assistance throughout. Both work, but bands better mimic unassisted Pullup mechanics.
