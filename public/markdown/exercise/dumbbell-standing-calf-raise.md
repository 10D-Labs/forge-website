## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand.
2. Raise your heels off the ground as high as possible, using your calves.
3. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your heels back down to the starting position.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Stand with the balls of your feet on a raised surface if available, allowing your heels to drop below for a full stretch.
- Rise up onto your toes as high as possible, squeezing the calves at the top for 1-2 seconds.
- Keep your knees straight (not locked) to target the gastrocnemius, which is the visible outer calf muscle.

## Common mistakes

- Bouncing at the bottom of the rep, using Achilles tendon elasticity instead of muscular contraction.
- Bending the knees during the raise, which shifts emphasis from the gastrocnemius to the soleus.
- Not using a full range of motion, particularly missing the bottom stretch that is critical for calf development.
