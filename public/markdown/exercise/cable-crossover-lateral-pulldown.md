## How to perform

1. Attach a cable handle to each side of a cable machine at shoulder height.
2. Stand in the middle of the machine with your feet shoulder-width apart.
3. Grasp the handles with an overhand grip and step back to create tension in the cables.
4. Lean forward slightly from the hips, keeping your back straight and your chest up.
5. Pull the handles down and across your body, squeezing your shoulder blades together.
6. Pause for a moment at the bottom of the movement, then slowly return to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Initiate the pull by depressing your shoulder blades first, then drive your elbows down and back to maximize lat engagement.
- Keep a slight forward lean from the hips so the cable path aligns with your lat fibers rather than your rear delts.
- Squeeze at the bottom for a full second with your lats fully contracted before slowly releasing back to the top.

## Common mistakes

- Standing too upright, which shifts the load to the rear delts and traps instead of the lats.
- Using momentum by jerking the handles down rather than controlling the movement through the full range of motion.
- Gripping too tightly, which causes the forearms and biceps to take over the pull.

## FAQ

### What is the difference between a Cable Crossover Lateral Pulldown and a lat pulldown?

The crossover version uses two independent cables from each side, which forces each lat to work independently and allows a wider arc of motion. A standard lat pulldown uses a single bar on one cable.

### Where should I feel the Cable Crossover Lateral Pulldown?

You should feel the primary stretch and contraction through the outer lats, with secondary engagement in the biceps and rhomboids as you squeeze your shoulder blades together at the bottom.

Start with a weight that lets you complete 10-12 controlled reps without swinging. Because each arm works independently, you will typically use less total weight than a standard lat pulldown.

### What muscles does the Cable Crossover Lateral Pulldown work?

The Cable Crossover Lateral Pulldown primarily targets the lats, with secondary activation in the biceps, rhomboids, rear deltoids. It's classified as a strength exercise for the back.
