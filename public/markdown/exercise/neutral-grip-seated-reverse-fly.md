## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height and position yourself on the machine with your chest against the pad and your feet flat on the floor.
2. Grasp the handles with a parallel grip, palms facing each other, and keep your arms slightly bent.
3. Exhale and squeeze your shoulder blades together as you pull the handles back and outward, away from your body.
4. Pause for a moment at the peak contraction, then inhale and slowly return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Initiate the movement by squeezing your shoulder blades together, not by pulling with your hands.
- Keep your chest firmly pressed against the pad to prevent using momentum from your torso.
- Use a slow, controlled tempo with a 2-second squeeze at the peak contraction.

## Common mistakes

- Shrugging the shoulders up toward the ears, which shifts the load from rear delts to upper traps.
- Using too heavy a weight and compensating by leaning back off the chest pad.
- Straightening the arms fully, which turns it into more of a rear delt row than a fly.
