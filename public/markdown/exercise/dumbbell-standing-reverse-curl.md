## How to perform

1. Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing your body.
2. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps. Continue to raise the weights until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level.
3. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
4. Inhale and slowly begin to lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hold dumbbells with an overhand grip (palms facing your body) and curl them to shoulder height without rotating the wrists.
- Keep your wrists locked in a straight line with your forearms to prevent wrist strain under the reverse grip.
- Use a 2-second lowering phase to maximize eccentric loading on the brachioradialis.

## Common mistakes

- Swinging the body to compensate for the weaker reverse grip, which removes forearm isolation.
- Bending the wrists backward during the curl, which strains the wrist extensors.
- Using the same weight as regular curls, which is too heavy for the mechanically disadvantaged reverse grip.

## FAQ

### What muscles does the standing reverse curl work?

Primarily the brachioradialis (outer forearm) and brachialis (under the biceps). The biceps still assist but are less activated than in a supinated curl.

### How much less weight should I use for reverse curls vs regular curls?

About 40-50% less. The overhand grip puts the biceps at a significant mechanical disadvantage, making the brachioradialis the primary mover.

### Should I do reverse curls on arm day or forearm day?

Both work. Including them on arm day ensures they get trained regularly. They are a bridge exercise that works both the upper arm and forearm.

### What muscles does the Dumbbell Standing Reverse Curl work?

The Dumbbell Standing Reverse Curl primarily targets the biceps, with secondary activation in the forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.

### Is the Dumbbell Standing Reverse Curl good for beginners?

Yes, the Dumbbell Standing Reverse Curl is rated as a beginner-level exercise. It's a great starting point for building biceps strength.
