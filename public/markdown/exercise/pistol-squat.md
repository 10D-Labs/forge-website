## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and arms extended in front of you.
2. Lift your right foot off the ground and extend it forward.
3. Slowly lower your body down by bending your left knee and pushing your hips back.
4. Keep your chest up and your back straight as you lower yourself down.
5. Lower until your left thigh is parallel to the ground, or as low as you can comfortably go.
6. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push through your left heel to return to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch legs.

## Pro tips

- Extend both arms forward for counterbalance as you descend on one leg.
- Keep your extended leg straight and elevated throughout; it should not touch the ground.
- Drive through the heel of your standing foot and squeeze the glute at the top to return to standing.

## Common mistakes

- Losing balance at the bottom by shifting weight too far forward or backward.
- Letting the extended leg drop and touch the floor, which provides assistance and reduces the difficulty.
- Not reaching full depth; a true Pistol Squat goes as deep as your mobility allows on one leg.
