## How to perform

2. Grasp the cable handles with an overhand grip, palms facing down.
3. Keep your back straight and lean slightly forward from the hips.

5. Pause for a moment at the peak of the movement, then slowly release the handles back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Maintain a rigid, upright torso throughout the entire set. The straight back position specifically targets the mid-back muscles and prevents lat dominance.
- Pull the handles to your lower ribs and squeeze your shoulder blades together for a two-second hold.
- Keep your chest lifted and think about pushing your chest forward as you pull back.

## Common mistakes

- Rounding the upper back during the pull, which defeats the purpose of the straight-back variation.
- Swinging the torso to generate momentum, which removes the strict posture requirement of this exercise.
- Shrugging the shoulders up as you pull, which recruits the upper traps and takes tension off the rhomboids.
