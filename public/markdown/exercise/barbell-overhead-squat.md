## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and toes slightly turned out.
2. Hold the barbell with a wide grip, positioning it overhead with your arms fully extended.
3. Engage your core and lower your body down into a squat position, keeping your chest up and knees tracking over your toes.
4. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push through your heels to return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use a snatch-width grip (wide) so the bar sits directly over your center of mass when overhead, not behind or in front of you.
- Actively Pushup against the bar throughout the entire squat to maintain a stable overhead position.
- Start with a PVC pipe or empty bar to build overhead squat mobility before adding any weight.

## Common mistakes

- Not having enough thoracic spine and shoulder mobility, causing the bar to drift forward as you descend.
- Using a grip that's too narrow, which makes it much harder to keep the bar over your center of gravity.
- Looking up at the bar during the squat, which compromises neck position and balance.
