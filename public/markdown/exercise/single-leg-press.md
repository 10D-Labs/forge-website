## How to perform

1. Sit in the leg press machine and place one foot in the center of the footplate.
2. Keep your other foot resting to the side or hovering near the platform.
3. Release the safety handles and lower the weight by bending your knee toward your chest.
4. Push through your heel to extend your leg back to the starting position without locking your knee.
5. Complete all reps on one leg before switching to the other.
6. When finished, carefully re-engage the safety handles.

## Pro tips

- Place your foot in the center of the platform at roughly hip height to balance quad and glute activation.
- Lower the weight until your knee reaches about 90 degrees of flexion, then drive through the heel to press back up.
- Start with about 40-50% of your bilateral Leg Press weight to account for the single-leg stability demand.

## Common mistakes

- Placing the foot too high on the platform, which over-emphasizes the glutes and hamstrings at the expense of the quads.
- Letting the knee cave inward during the press, which stresses the medial knee ligaments.
- Lowering the weight too deep, allowing the lower back to round off the pad.
