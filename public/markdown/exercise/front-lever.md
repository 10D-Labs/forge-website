## How to perform

1. Start by hanging from a pullup bar with an overhand grip, hands shoulder-width apart.
2. Engage your core and pull your shoulder blades down and back.
3. Bend your knees and tuck them towards your chest.
4. Simultaneously, lift your legs up and extend them straight out in front of you, keeping your body parallel to the ground.
5. Hold this position for as long as you can, aiming for a full front lever position.
6. To release, slowly lower your legs back down and return to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Start with tuck Front Lever holds and gradually extend one leg at a time before attempting the full position.
- Actively pull the bar toward your hips (as if doing a straight-arm pulldown) to engage your lats throughout the hold.
- Keep your body rigid from head to toe by squeezing your glutes and pointing your toes.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the hips sag below the shoulder line, which turns it into a partial Front Lever with much less lat engagement.
- Holding your breath instead of breathing in a controlled rhythm during the isometric hold.
- Skipping the progression steps and attempting a full Front Lever too soon, leading to bicep tendon strain.
