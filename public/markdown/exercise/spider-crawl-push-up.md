## How to perform

1. Start in a pushup position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and your feet together.
2. Bring your right knee towards your right elbow, keeping it off the ground.
3. As you bring your right knee back, simultaneously lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows.
4. Push back up to the starting position and repeat with your left knee towards your left elbow.
5. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Bring your knee to your elbow as you lower into the Pushup, timing the knee drive with the descent.
- Keep your hips low and level; don't pike up or let them sag during the crawling motion.
- Alternate sides smoothly and maintain a consistent tempo throughout the set.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the hips rise into a pike position when bringing the knee to the elbow.
- Only touching the knee to the inside of the arm instead of driving it all the way to the elbow for full hip flexion.
- Performing the knee drive and the Pushup at different times instead of synchronizing them.
