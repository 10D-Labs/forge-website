3. Lower the dumbbell back to shoulder level.
4. Repeat with the other arm.
5. Continue alternating arms for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Press one dumbbell overhead while keeping the other at shoulder height, alternating arms for each rep.
- Brace your core hard to prevent your torso from swaying side to side with each alternating press.
- Press each dumbbell straight up over the shoulder, not toward the center of your body.

## Common mistakes

- Resting the non-pressing dumbbell on the shoulder or lowering it to the side between reps, reducing constant tension.
- Leaning to the side opposite the pressing arm to compensate for the unilateral load.
- Using leg drive by dipping the knees, which turns this into a push press rather than a strict press.
