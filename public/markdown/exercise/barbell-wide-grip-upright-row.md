## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a barbell with an overhand grip, hands wider than shoulder-width apart.
2. Let the barbell hang in front of your thighs, arms fully extended.
3. Keeping your back straight, exhale and lift the barbell straight up towards your chin, leading with your elbows.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then inhale and slowly lower the barbell back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Use a grip wider than shoulder width (about 1.5x) and lead with the elbows, pulling the bar up along your body.
- The wider grip reduces the impingement risk compared to a narrow grip and shifts more emphasis to the lateral delts.
- Stop the pull when your elbows reach shoulder height and control the descent.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling the bar too high past shoulder level, which compresses the supraspinatus tendon.
- Using too much body swing to compensate for the grip width reducing your mechanical advantage.
- Shrugging the shoulders up instead of pulling with the deltoids.

## FAQ

### Is the wide grip upright row better for the shoulders than narrow grip?

Yes, the wider grip reduces internal rotation of the shoulder, decreasing impingement risk. It also shifts more work to the lateral deltoids and away from the traps.

### Can wide grip upright rows replace Lateral Raises?

They can partially replace them since both target the lateral deltoids. However, Lateral Raises isolate the side delts more purely. Using both provides the most complete side delt development.

### What's the ideal grip width?

About 1.5 times shoulder width. This is wide enough to reduce impingement risk but not so wide that the range of motion becomes too short to be effective.

The Barbell Wide Grip Upright Row primarily targets the shoulders, with secondary activation in the traps, biceps. It's classified as a strength exercise for the shoulders.
