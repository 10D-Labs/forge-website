## How to perform

1. Lie flat on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing each other and arms extended straight up.
2. Lower the dumbbells to the sides of your chest, keeping your elbows at a 90 degree angle.
3. Press the dumbbells back up to the starting position, fully extending your arms.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your palms facing each other (hammer grip) for the entire press to shift emphasis toward the inner chest and triceps.
- Lower the dumbbells to the sides of your chest with elbows at roughly 45 degrees, not flared out wide.
- Press the dumbbells straight up and slightly inward at the top to maximize chest contraction with the neutral grip.

## Common mistakes

- Flaring elbows out to 90 degrees, which increases shoulder stress and reduces the benefit of the neutral grip.
- Rotating the wrists during the press so palms face forward, negating the hammer grip advantage.
- Bouncing the dumbbells off the chest at the bottom instead of pausing for a controlled reversal.
