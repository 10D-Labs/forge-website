## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench or chair with your feet flat on the ground.
2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with an overhand grip, palms facing down.
3. Rest your forearms on your thighs, allowing your wrists to hang off the edge.
4. Slowly curl your wrists upward, bringing the dumbbells towards your body.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Grip the dumbbells with palms facing down, rest forearms on your thighs, and curl your wrists upward to target the forearm extensors.
- Move only from the wrist joint; keep your forearms completely stationary on your thighs.
- Use a slow 2-second up and 2-second down tempo to maximize extensor engagement with light weight.

## Common mistakes

- Going too heavy, which causes the wrists to jerk rather than curl smoothly and risks extensor tendon strain.
- Lifting the forearms off the thighs during the curl, adding elbow flexion that shifts work away from the wrist extensors.
- Only performing partial range of motion by not lowering the wrists fully between reps.
