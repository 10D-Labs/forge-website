## How to perform

1. Stand up straight with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing forward and arms fully extended.
2. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps.
3. Continue to raise the dumbbells until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level.
4. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
5. Inhale and slowly begin to lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, alternating arms.

## Pro tips

- Alternate arms each rep so one arm rests while the other works. This allows you to maintain better form over more total reps than simultaneous curls.
- Supinate your wrist (rotate palm upward) as you curl to maximize bicep peak contraction. Start with palms facing your sides and rotate as you lift.
- Keep your torso completely still. If your upper body sways, the weight is too heavy.

## Common mistakes

- Swinging the body side to side with each alternating curl to generate momentum.
- Not fully extending the arm at the bottom between reps, which limits the stretch and reduces range of motion.
- Curling both dumbbells at the same time instead of alternating, which reduces the rest benefit and form focus.
