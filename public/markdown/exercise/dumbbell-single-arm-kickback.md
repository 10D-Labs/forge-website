## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell in your right hand.
2. Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight.
3. Bring your right elbow up to your side, keeping it bent at a 90 degree angle.
4. Extend your right arm straight back, squeezing your triceps at the top of the movement.
5. Slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch sides.

## Pro tips

- Place your non-working hand and knee on a bench for stability, keeping your back flat and parallel to the ground.
- Lock your upper arm at your side and extend only from the elbow, squeezing the triceps fully at the top.
- Hold the fully extended position for one second on each rep to maximize the peak contraction.

## Common mistakes

- Dropping the upper arm below parallel to the floor during the kickback, which eliminates the hardest portion of the range of motion.
- Swinging the dumbbell using shoulder momentum rather than a strict elbow extension.
- Rounding the back instead of keeping a flat spine, which can cause lower back strain.
