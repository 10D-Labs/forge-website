## How to perform

1. Sit on a chair or bench with your back straight and feet flat on the ground.
2. Place a resistance band around your thighs, just above your knees.
3. Keep your knees bent at a 90 degree angle and your feet shoulder-width apart.
4. Engage your glutes and slowly rotate your knees outward, pushing against the resistance of the band.
5. Pause for a moment at the end of the movement, then slowly return to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Sit upright with good posture and rotate your knees outward against the band to work the external hip rotators.
- Keep your feet flat on the ground and only move from the hips, not the ankles.
- Hold the open position for 1-2 seconds to maximize glute med and rotator activation.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning to one side or the other instead of staying centered and symmetrical.
- Moving the feet apart instead of rotating at the hip joint, which cheats the range of motion.
- Using too strong a band that prevents a full range of hip rotation.
