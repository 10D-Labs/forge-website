## How to perform

1. Stand facing the cable machine with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Bend at the hips and knees, lowering your torso until your back is parallel to the ground.
3. Grasp the cable handles with an overhand grip, keeping your arms straight and your shoulders back.
4. Engage your glutes and hamstrings to lift the cable handles, extending your hips and standing up straight.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the cable handles back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Stand far enough from the machine so the cable pulls at a slight forward angle, which keeps tension on the glutes and hamstrings throughout the lift.
- Drive your hips forward explosively at the top and squeeze your glutes hard rather than pulling with your lower back.
- Keep the cable handles close to your body as you rise, mimicking the bar path of a Barbell Deadlift.

## Common mistakes

- Rounding the lower back at the bottom of the movement because the cable pulls you forward. Brace your core and maintain a neutral spine.
- Standing too close to the machine, which reduces the effective range of motion and minimizes glute and hamstring engagement.
- Leaning back at the top instead of finishing with a strong hip lockout, which stresses the lower back.
