## How to perform

1. Sit on the edge of a bench or chair with your hands gripping the edge, fingers pointing forward.
2. Slide your butt off the bench, supporting your weight with your hands.
3. Bend your elbows and lower your body towards the ground, keeping your back close to the bench.
4. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then push yourself back up to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your elbows tucked close to your body and pointing straight behind you throughout the movement.
- Lean your torso slightly forward to engage a bit of chest, or stay perfectly upright to isolate the triceps more.
- Exhale forcefully as you press up to help generate more power through the sticking point.

## Common mistakes

- Descending too quickly without controlling the eccentric, which increases shoulder strain and reduces time under tension.
- Locking out aggressively at the top, hyperextending the elbows instead of stopping just short of full lockout.
- Rounding the upper back forward, which disengages the triceps and loads the shoulders.
