## How to perform

1. Attach the band to a pullup bar or sturdy anchor point.
2. Step onto the band with your feet or knees and grip the bar with your palms facing away from you, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3. Hang with your arms fully extended, keeping your core engaged and your shoulders down and back.
4. Pull your body up towards the bar by squeezing your shoulder blades together and driving your elbows down towards your hips.
5. Continue pulling until your chin is above the bar, then slowly lower yourself back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Place your knee or foot in the band loop and let it assist you most at the bottom where Pullups are hardest.
- Use the same strict form as an unassisted Pullup: full dead hang at the bottom, chin over bar at the top.
- Progress to thinner bands over time rather than jumping straight to unassisted Pullups.

## Common mistakes

- Relying on the band to do most of the work instead of actively pulling with your back muscles.
- Not achieving full range of motion at the bottom by keeping the arms slightly bent throughout.
- Using a band that is too thick, which makes the exercise too easy and delays progression to unassisted Pullups.
