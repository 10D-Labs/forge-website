## How to perform

1. Stand up straight with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing forward and arms fully extended.
2. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps.
3. Continue to raise the dumbbells until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level.
4. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
5. Inhale and slowly begin to lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your elbows pinned to your sides throughout the curl and supinate (turn palms up) as you lift for maximum bicep activation.
- Control the lowering phase for at least 2 seconds to maximize the eccentric stimulus, which is key for bicep growth.
- Avoid swinging the body; stand with a slight forward lean and flex your glutes to create a stable base.

## Common mistakes

- Swinging the torso or using hip thrust to curl heavier weight, which takes work off the biceps.
- Letting the elbows drift forward during the curl, which recruits the front delts to assist.
- Not lowering the dumbbells to full arm extension, cutting the range of motion short.
