## How to perform

1. Adjust the smith machine bar to a height that allows you to stand with your feet flat on the ground and your shoulders under the bar.
2. Position yourself under the bar with your feet shoulder-width apart and your toes pointing forward.
3. Place your hands on the bar for stability.
4. Engage your calves and slowly raise your heels off the ground, lifting your body up onto your toes.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your heels back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Stand on a raised surface (plate or block) so your heels can drop below the platform for a full stretch.
- Rise all the way onto your toes and squeeze the calves for 2 seconds at the top of each rep.
- Keep your knees straight but not hyperextended to target the gastrocnemius over the soleus.

## Common mistakes

- Standing on flat ground without a raised surface, which eliminates the bottom stretch portion of the range of motion.
- Bouncing at the bottom of the rep instead of pausing and using controlled muscle contraction.
- Bending the knees, which shifts the emphasis from the gastrocnemius to the soleus.
