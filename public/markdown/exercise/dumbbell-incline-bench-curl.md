## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in one hand.
2. Place your other hand on an incline bench for support.
3. Keeping your upper arm stationary, curl the dumbbell towards your shoulder by contracting your biceps.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch arms.

## Pro tips

- Stand next to the incline bench and use it as a bracing surface for your non-working arm while curling with the other.
- Let your working arm hang straight down and curl from a fully stretched position for maximum range of motion.
- Keep your upper arm vertical throughout; don't let it swing forward or backward.

## Common mistakes

- Not bracing properly against the bench, which allows the body to rock and introduce momentum.
- Curling the dumbbell across the body instead of straight up, which reduces bicep isolation.
- Cutting the rep short at the bottom by not fully extending the arm between curls.
