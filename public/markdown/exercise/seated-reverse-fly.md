## How to perform

1. Adjust the seat height and position yourself on the machine with your chest against the pad and your feet flat on the floor.
2. Grasp the handles with an overhand grip and keep your arms slightly bent.
3. Exhale and squeeze your shoulder blades together as you pull the handles back and outward, away from your body.
4. Pause for a moment at the peak contraction, then inhale and slowly return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Think about driving your elbows back and apart rather than pulling with your hands to engage the rear delts.
- Keep the movement arc wide; your hands should travel outward, not straight back.
- Maintain a slight bend in the elbows that stays consistent throughout the entire rep.

## Common mistakes

- Bending the elbows more as you pull back, turning the fly into a row.
- Rocking the torso off the chest pad to generate momentum on heavier sets.
- Allowing the wrists to rotate or bend during the movement.

## FAQ

### How do I adjust the machine for reverse flys vs chest flys?

Most pec deck machines have a pin or lever that changes the handle start position. For reverse flys, set the handles so they're close together in front and you face the pad with your chest.

### How many sets of reverse flys should I do per week?

Most people benefit from 3-4 sets, 2-3 times per week to adequately develop the rear delts, which are commonly underdeveloped compared to the front and side delts.

### Should I do reverse flys before or after pressing exercises?

Doing them before pressing can pre-activate your rear delts and improve shoulder stability during presses. Doing them after pressing ensures you hit them when rear delt fatigue won't limit your press performance. Either works.

### What muscles does the Seated Reverse Fly work?

The Seated Reverse Fly primarily targets the shoulders, with secondary activation in the trapezius, rhomboids. It's classified as a strength exercise for the shoulders.
