## Pro tips

- Rest the bar on your front deltoids with elbows high (upper arms parallel to the floor) to maintain the rack position.
- Keep your torso as upright as possible throughout the squat to prevent the bar from rolling forward.
- Push your knees out over your toes and squat to at least parallel depth for full quad and glute activation.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning too far forward, turning the front squat into a good-morning-like movement.
- Not squatting deep enough due to the unfamiliar front rack position.
