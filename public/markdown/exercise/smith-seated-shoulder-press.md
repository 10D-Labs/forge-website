- Position the bench so the bar lowers to just below chin level, in front of your face, not behind your head.
- Press straight up and finish with the bar directly over your shoulders, not in front of you.
- Keep your core braced and avoid excessive arching of the lower back.

- Arching the lower back excessively to press heavier weight, turning it into an incline press.
- Not lowering the bar far enough; bring it to at least chin level for a full range of motion.
