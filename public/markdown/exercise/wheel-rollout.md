3. Engage your core muscles and slowly roll the wheel forward, keeping your back straight and your abs tight.
4. Continue rolling forward until your body is fully extended and your arms are overhead.
5. Pause for a moment, then slowly roll the wheel back towards your knees, maintaining control and keeping your abs engaged.

## Pro tips

- Tuck your pelvis slightly (posterior Pelvic Tilt) before rolling out to protect your lower back.
- Only roll out as far as you can while maintaining a flat back; do not let your hips sag.
- Squeeze your abs to pull the wheel back rather than using your hip flexors or arms.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the lower back hyperextend as you roll out, which compresses the lumbar spine under load.
- Rolling out too far before building sufficient core strength, leading to a collapse at the bottom.
- Bending at the hips on the return instead of keeping the body in a straight line and using the abs to pull back.
