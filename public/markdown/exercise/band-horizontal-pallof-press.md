## How to perform

1. Attach the band to a sturdy anchor point at waist height.
2. Stand perpendicular to the anchor point with your feet shoulder-width apart.
3. Grasp the band handle with both hands and step away from the anchor point to create tension in the band.
4. Bring your hands to your chest, keeping your elbows bent and close to your body.

6. Extend your arms straight out in front of you, pushing the band away from your body.

## Pro tips

- Brace your core as if you are about to be punched in the stomach before pressing the band out.
- Press the band straight out from your chest and hold the extended position for 2-3 seconds to maximize anti-rotation demand.
- Stand far enough from the anchor point that there is significant tension even with arms at your chest.

- Rotating toward the anchor point when pressing out, which means the core is not resisting the rotation.
- Pressing too quickly without holding the extended position, which reduces the anti-rotation challenge.
- Standing too close to the anchor point, resulting in insufficient band tension to challenge the core.
