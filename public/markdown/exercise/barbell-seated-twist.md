## How to perform

1. Sit on a flat bench with your feet flat on the ground and your knees bent.
2. Hold a barbell with both hands in front of your chest, keeping your elbows slightly bent.
3. Engage your core and slowly twist your torso to one side, keeping your back straight.
4. Pause for a moment at the end of the twist, then slowly rotate back to the starting position.
5. Repeat the twist to the other side.
6. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Rotate from your thoracic spine (mid-back), not your lower back; your lumbar spine should stay relatively stable.
- Hold the bar across your upper back or in front of your chest and twist slowly with a 2-second rotation to each side.
- Engage your obliques to drive the rotation and resist the return, don't just swing passively.

## Common mistakes

- Twisting too fast and using momentum instead of controlled oblique contraction.
- Rotating from the hips instead of the mid-back, which doesn't effectively target the obliques.
- Loading too much weight on the bar, which can strain the lower back during rotation.

## FAQ

### Are seated barbell twists good for the obliques?

They provide moderate oblique activation. The resistance is limited because the barbell doesn't create much rotational load. Cable woodchops and landmine rotations are more effective for building rotational strength.

### Can barbell twists slim my waist?

No exercise can spot-reduce fat. Barbell twists strengthen the obliques, which improves core function and rotational power. Fat loss comes from a caloric deficit.

### Is there a risk of lower back injury with seated twists?

Yes, if you rotate aggressively or from the lumbar spine. The lower back is designed for stability, not rotation. Move slowly, rotate from the mid-back, and use light weight.

### What muscles does the Barbell Seated Twist work?

The Barbell Seated Twist primarily targets the abs, with secondary activation in the obliques, lower back. It's classified as a strength exercise for the core.
