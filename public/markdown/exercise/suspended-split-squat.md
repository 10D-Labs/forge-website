## How to perform

1. Stand facing away from a suspension trainer with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Extend one leg forward and place the top of your foot in the foot cradle of the suspension trainer.
3. Bend your standing leg and lower your body down into a lunge position, keeping your chest up and your knee in line with your toes.
4. Push through your heel to return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch legs.

## Pro tips

- Keep most of your weight on the front foot; the rear foot in the strap is for balance, not support.
- Lower straight down until your front thigh is parallel to the floor, keeping your torso upright.
- Drive through the front heel to stand back up, squeezing the glute at the top.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning too far forward, which overloads the lower back and reduces glute activation.
- Standing too close to the anchor point, which doesn't allow enough range of motion.
- Letting the front knee cave inward during the descent, indicating weak hip stabilizers.

## FAQ

### Is the Suspended Split Squat the same as a Bulgarian split squat?

Very similar. The main difference is that the rear foot is in an unstable suspension strap rather than on a solid bench, which increases the balance and stabilization demand significantly.

### Why does my rear foot cramp in the strap?

The ankle of the rear foot is in plantarflexion (pointed) for the entire set. This is common initially. Stretch your feet and ankles beforehand, and the cramping typically resolves as you adapt.

### How far should I stand from the anchor point?

Stand about 3-4 feet from the anchor point. You should be able to lower into a full split squat without the strap pulling you backward. Adjust the distance until the movement feels smooth.

### What muscles does the Suspended Split Squat work?

The Suspended Split Squat primarily targets the quads, with secondary activation in the glutes, hamstrings, calves. It's classified as a strength exercise for the legs.

### Is the Suspended Split Squat good for beginners?

The Suspended Split Squat is an advanced exercise. Beginners should master fundamental legs movements first.
