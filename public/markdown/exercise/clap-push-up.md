## How to perform

1. Start in a high plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
2. Lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows, keeping your core engaged.
3. Push through your palms explosively to propel your body off the ground.
4. While in mid-air, clap your hands together before landing back in the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Push off the ground explosively enough to get your hands completely airborne before clapping.
- Land with slightly bent elbows to absorb the impact and immediately flow into the next rep.
- Keep your body in a rigid plank throughout; do not let the hips pike up during the explosive push.

## Common mistakes

- Not generating enough height, which results in a rushed clap and poor landing position.
- Landing with locked elbows, which sends shock through the wrists, elbows, and shoulders.
- Letting the hips sag or pike during the explosive phase, which reduces power transfer.
