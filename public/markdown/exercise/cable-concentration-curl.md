## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench or chair with your feet flat on the floor and your knees slightly bent.
2. Hold the cable handle with an underhand grip and rest your elbow against the inside of your thigh.
3. Keeping your upper arm stationary, exhale and curl the cable handle towards your shoulder while contracting your biceps.
4. Pause for a moment at the top of the movement, then inhale and slowly lower the cable handle back to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch arms.

## Pro tips

- Press your working elbow firmly into the inside of your thigh to create a fixed pivot point that isolates the bicep completely.
- Curl the handle all the way to shoulder height and squeeze the bicep for 2 seconds at the peak.
- Use a slow, 3-second negative on every rep to maximize time under tension.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the elbow slide off the thigh during the curl, which allows the shoulder to assist and reduces bicep isolation.
- Rotating the torso toward the working arm to help complete the rep instead of using pure bicep contraction.
- Choosing too heavy a weight, which forces you to use momentum and defeats the isolation purpose.

## FAQ

### How is the Cable Concentration Curl different from a Dumbbell Concentration Curl?

The cable provides constant tension throughout the entire curl, including the top where a dumbbell would normally lose tension due to gravity. This creates a more complete contraction.

### Which arm should I train first?

Start with your weaker arm and match the reps with your stronger arm. This prevents imbalances from growing over time.

### Is the concentration curl good for building the bicep peak?

Yes, the supinated, isolated curl position with a peak contraction is one of the best movements for developing the bicep peak, especially the long head.

### What muscles does the Cable Concentration Curl work?

The Cable Concentration Curl primarily targets the biceps, with secondary activation in the forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.

### Is the Cable Concentration Curl good for beginners?

Yes, the Cable Concentration Curl is rated as a beginner-level exercise. It's a great starting point for building biceps strength.
