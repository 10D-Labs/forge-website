## How to perform

1. Attach cables to both sides of a cable machine at chest height.
2. Stand in the center of the machine with one foot slightly in front of the other.
3. Grasp the handles with an overhand grip and extend your arms out to the sides.
4. Keep a slight bend in your elbows and maintain a slight forward lean.
5. Engage your chest muscles and bring your arms forward in a sweeping motion.
6. Pause for a moment at the center, then slowly return your arms back to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Set the pulleys at chest height so the cable pulls directly to the sides, isolating the sternal (middle) fibers of the chest.
- Step forward past the cable columns into a staggered stance to increase the stretch at the starting position.
- Focus on squeezing your pecs together at the front of the movement rather than pushing with your hands.

## Common mistakes

- Setting the pulleys too high or too low, which changes the angle and turns this into a high or low fly instead of a middle chest fly.
- Straightening the elbows completely, which increases elbow joint stress. Keep a consistent slight bend.
- Bringing the hands together too far past center, which reduces tension on the chest and wastes the contraction.
