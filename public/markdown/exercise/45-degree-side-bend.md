## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your arms extended straight down by your sides.
2. Keeping your back straight and your core engaged, slowly bend your torso to one side, lowering your hand towards your knee.
3. Pause for a moment at the bottom, then slowly return to the starting position.
4. Repeat on the other side.
5. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Think about shortening the distance between your bottom rib and hip bone on the bending side rather than just reaching your hand down.
- Keep your hips perfectly still and square; all movement should come from your torso bending laterally.
- Perform the movement slowly with a 2-second descent and 2-second return to maximize oblique engagement.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning forward or backward instead of bending purely to the side, which turns it into a partial crunch.
- Swinging the torso using momentum rather than controlling the bend with the obliques.
- Shifting the hips to the opposite side to compensate, which reduces the stretch and contraction on the target side.

## FAQ

### Do side bends make your waist wider?

No. Oblique hypertrophy from bodyweight side bends is minimal. You'd need heavy weighted side bends over a long period to see noticeable oblique growth. Bodyweight versions primarily build endurance and core stability.

### Should I hold a weight during 45 Degree Side Bends?

Start with bodyweight to master the movement pattern. Once you can do 20+ controlled reps, hold a light dumbbell in one hand to add resistance on the opposite side.

### How do 45 Degree Side Bends differ from standing oblique crunches?

Side bends focus on lateral flexion through a longer range of motion, while oblique crunches typically involve rotating the torso. Side bends isolate the obliques more directly.

### What muscles does the 45 Degree Side Bend work?

The 45 Degree Side Bend primarily targets the abs, with secondary activation in the obliques. It's classified as a strength exercise for the core.
