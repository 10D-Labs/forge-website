2. Bend your knees and place your feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart.
3. Place your hands behind your head with your elbows pointing outwards.
4. Engage your abs and lean to one side, bringing your elbow towards your hip.
5. Pause for a moment, then return to the starting position.
6. Repeat on the other side.
7. Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Keep your back flat against the wall to isolate the obliques and prevent cheating with momentum.
- Focus on bringing your ribs toward your hip rather than just dropping your elbow down.
- Exhale forcefully as you crunch to the side to maximize oblique contraction.

## Common mistakes

- Pulling the head forward with the hands instead of driving the movement from the obliques.
- Leaning the entire torso to the side rather than performing a lateral crunch with the ribcage.
- Coming away from the wall to generate momentum, which defeats the purpose of the wall support.
