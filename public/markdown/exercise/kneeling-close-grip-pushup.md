2. Lower your upper body towards the ground by bending your elbows, keeping them close to your sides.
3. Pause for a moment when your chest is just above the ground.
4. Push through your palms to straighten your arms and return to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Place your hands directly under your shoulders or slightly narrower to maximize tricep activation.
- Keep your elbows tucked close to your ribs, pointing backward, not flaring outward.
- Lower your chest between your hands and press back up by fully extending your arms for a complete tricep contraction.

## Common mistakes

- Placing the hands too far forward, which shifts the load to the shoulders and away from the triceps.
- Letting the hips sag or pike up, breaking the straight line from knees to shoulders.
- Not fully extending the arms at the top, which cuts the tricep lockout and reduces muscle activation.
