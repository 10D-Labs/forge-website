## How to perform

1. Sit on a preacher bench with your upper arms resting on the pad and your chest against the support.
2. Grasp the barbell with an underhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the barbell up towards your shoulders.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, squeezing your biceps.
5. Inhale and slowly lower the barbell back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Press the back of your upper arms firmly into the pad for the entire set; if they lift off, you're using momentum.
- Lower the bar until your arms are nearly fully extended (about 95%) to get the full stretch, but don't hyperextend the elbows.
- Use a slow, controlled eccentric (3-4 seconds) because the stretched position under load is where bicep growth is stimulated most.

## Common mistakes

- Lifting the elbows off the pad at the bottom to swing the weight up, which eliminates the isolation benefit.
- Fully locking out the elbows at the bottom, which puts dangerous stress on the bicep tendon in the stretched position.
- Leaning back off the pad to cheat the bar up on the last few reps.

## FAQ

### Why do Preacher Curls feel harder than standing curls?

The pad prevents you from using body momentum and keeps your upper arms in a fixed position. This makes the bicep do all the work, eliminating the cheating that's common in standing curls.

### Should I go all the way down on Preacher Curls?

Go to about 95% extension. A slight bend at the bottom protects the distal bicep tendon from excessive strain. Never bounce at the bottom of a Preacher Curl.

### Is an EZ bar or straight bar better for Preacher Curls?

An EZ bar is more comfortable for most people's wrists and elbows on the preacher bench. The slight wrist angle doesn't reduce bicep activation meaningfully.

### What muscles does the Barbell Preacher Curl work?

The Barbell Preacher Curl primarily targets the biceps, with secondary activation in the forearms. It's classified as a strength exercise for the arms.

### Is the Barbell Preacher Curl good for beginners?

Yes, the Barbell Preacher Curl is rated as a beginner-level exercise. It's a great starting point for building biceps strength.
