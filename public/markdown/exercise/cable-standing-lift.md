## How to perform

1. Stand facing the cable machine with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. Hold the cable handle with both hands and position it at waist height.
3. Engage your core and maintain a straight back throughout the exercise.
4. Keeping your arms straight, exhale and lift the cable handle up towards your opposite shoulder, rotating your torso.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then inhale and slowly lower the cable handle back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch sides.

## Pro tips

- Start with the cable at a low position and lift diagonally across your body to the opposite shoulder. This is essentially a reverse wood chop pattern.
- Rotate through your hips and core, not just your arms. Your arms should stay relatively straight and act as levers for the trunk rotation.
- Pivot your back foot as you rotate upward to allow full hip rotation and protect your knees.

## Common mistakes

- Lifting with the arms and shoulders instead of rotating through the core, which defeats the purpose of this rotational ab exercise.
- Keeping the feet planted flat, which limits rotational range and can stress the knees and lower back.
- Rounding the back during the lift instead of maintaining a tall, neutral spine throughout.
