## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with your legs spread apart and a dumbbell in one hand, resting your elbow on the inside of your thigh.
2. Fully extend your arm and hold the dumbbell with an underhand grip.
3. Keeping your upper arm stationary, exhale and curl the weight up towards your shoulder while contracting your biceps.
4. Continue to raise the dumbbell until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbell is at shoulder level.
5. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
6. Inhale and slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch arms.

## Pro tips

- Sit on a bench with your legs spread, and brace the back of your working arm against your inner thigh. This eliminates all body momentum.
- Curl the dumbbell slowly and squeeze at the top for 2 seconds. The braced position makes this one of the best exercises for bicep peak isolation.
- Lower the dumbbell all the way to full arm extension. The full stretch at the bottom under load is where the bicep grows.

## Common mistakes

- Leaning the torso forward and using the shoulder to swing the dumbbell up, rather than isolating the bicep.
- Not bracing the arm firmly against the thigh, which allows the elbow to move and reduces isolation.
- Using too much weight, which forces compensating movements and defeats the isolation purpose of this exercise.
