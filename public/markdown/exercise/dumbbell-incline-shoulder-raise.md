## How to perform

1. Set an incline bench to a 45 degree angle and sit on it with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing down.
2. Rest the dumbbells on your thighs and lean back onto the bench.
3. Use your thighs to help raise the dumbbells to shoulder height, then rotate your wrists so that your palms are facing forward.
4. Exhale and slowly raise the dumbbells above your head, keeping a slight bend in your elbows.
5. Move the dumbbells up and down by moving only your shoulders.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Focus on moving through the shoulder joint only, keeping the arms relatively fixed, to target the serratus anterior effectively.
- Push your shoulder blades forward (protract) at the top of the movement to fully engage the serratus muscle.
- Use light weight and prioritize the mind-muscle connection with the serratus rather than chasing heavy loads.

## Common mistakes

- Turning this into a standard overhead press by bending and extending the elbows, which shifts work to the deltoids and triceps.
- Using too heavy a weight, making it impossible to isolate the scapular movement that targets the serratus anterior.
- Failing to protract the shoulder blades at the top, which is the key action that activates the serratus.
