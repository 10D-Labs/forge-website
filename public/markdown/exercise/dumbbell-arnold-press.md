## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with back support and hold a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder level, palms facing your body and elbows bent.
2. Press the dumbbells upward until your arms are fully extended and your palms are facing forward.
3. Rotate your wrists as you lift, so that your palms are facing forward at the top of the movement.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Start with palms facing you at the bottom and rotate smoothly so palms face forward at the top; the rotation should happen through the middle third of the press.
- Keep your elbows slightly in front of your body at the bottom position to protect the shoulder joint.
- Use a controlled 2-second rotation on the way up and down rather than rushing through the twist.

## Common mistakes

- Rotating the wrists too early or too late in the movement, which defeats the purpose of the Arnold press and reduces front delt activation.
- Arching the lower back excessively to compensate for heavy weight, which risks spinal injury.
- Locking out the elbows aggressively at the top, which shifts tension from the shoulders to the joints.
