## How to perform

1. Adjust the machine to the appropriate height for your body.
2. Position yourself facing the machine, with your toes on the foot platform and your heels hanging off the edge.
3. Place your hands on the handles or the support bars for stability.
4. Engage your calves and lift your heels as high as possible, using the balls of your feet.
5. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower your heels back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Position your lower back under the pad and your toes on the edge of the platform with heels hanging off.
- Drop your heels as low as possible for a full calf stretch before driving up onto your toes.
- Pause for 2 seconds at the top with a full calf contraction on every rep.

## Common mistakes

- Bouncing at the bottom of the rep to use momentum, which reduces calf engagement and increases Achilles tendon stress.
- Not using a full range of motion by failing to lower the heels below the platform level.
- Placing too much weight and compensating with hip flexion rather than ankle extension.
