4. Hinge at the hips and lean forward, maintaining a neutral spine.
5. Extend your right leg straight back, squeezing your glutes at the top.
6. Lower your right leg back down and repeat with the left leg.
7. Continue alternating legs for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Hinge forward at the hips and kick one leg straight back against the band resistance, squeezing the glute at full extension.
- Keep your hips square to the ground and avoid rotating your pelvis as you kick back.
- Pause at the top for a one-second glute squeeze before lowering the leg back down.

## Common mistakes

- Arching the lower back to get the leg higher instead of hinging at the hip and extending from the glute.
- Rotating the hip open to cheat the range of motion, which takes the load off the glute.
- Using momentum to swing the leg instead of controlled glute contraction.
