## How to perform

1. Set an incline bench to a 45 degree angle and sit on it with a dumbbell in each hand, resting on your thighs.
2. Lie back on the bench and position the dumbbells at shoulder level with your palms facing each other.
3. Press the dumbbells up and away from your body until your arms are fully extended.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Set the bench at 30-45 degrees and use a neutral grip (palms facing each other). This hammer grip recruits the inner chest and triceps more than a standard incline press.
- Keep the dumbbells close together throughout the press, nearly touching at the top.
- Lower the dumbbells to the sides of your upper chest with your elbows at about 45 degrees, then press up and slightly inward.

## Common mistakes

- Rotating the wrists during the press, which changes the exercise from a hammer press to a standard press.
- Letting the dumbbells drift apart at the top, which reduces inner chest contraction.
- Setting the bench angle too high, which turns this into a shoulder press rather than an Incline Chest Press.
