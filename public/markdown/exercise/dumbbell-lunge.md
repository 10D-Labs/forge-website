## How to perform

1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand.
2. Take a step forward with your right foot, lowering your body into a lunge position.
3. Keep your back straight and your chest up as you lower your body.
4. Push through your right heel to return to the starting position.
5. Repeat with your left leg.
6. Alternate legs for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Take a long enough stride that your front knee stays directly over your ankle at the bottom, not pushed past your toes.
- Keep your torso upright and eyes forward throughout the lunge to maintain balance and protect your lower back.
- Push through the heel of your front foot to drive back to standing, which emphasizes the glutes over the quads.

## Common mistakes

- Taking too short a step, which forces the knee past the toes and puts excessive stress on the knee joint.
- Leaning the torso forward excessively, which shifts the load off the legs and strains the lower back.
- Letting the back knee slam into the ground instead of lowering it with control just above the floor.
