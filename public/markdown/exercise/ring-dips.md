## How to perform

1. Start by hanging from the rings with your arms fully extended and your body straight.
2. Lower your body by bending your elbows until your shoulders are below your elbows.
3. Push yourself back up to the starting position by straightening your arms.
4. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Turn the rings outward at the top of each rep (externally rotate) to fully lock out and stabilize the position.
- Keep the rings close to your body and your elbows tracking straight back, not flaring outward.
- Lower yourself slowly and don't go deeper than your shoulder being level with your elbow until you've built adequate strength.

## Common mistakes

- Letting the rings drift away from the body, which puts the shoulders in a compromised position.
- Going too deep too soon before building the shoulder stability to support the bottom position.
- Not achieving full lockout at the top with the rings turned out, which is where the stability demand is highest.
