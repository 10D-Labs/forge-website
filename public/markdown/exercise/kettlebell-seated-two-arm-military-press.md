## How to perform

1. Sit on a bench with your back straight and feet flat on the ground.
2. Hold a kettlebell in each hand at shoulder level with your palms facing forward.
3. Press the kettlebells overhead by extending your arms fully.
4. Pause for a moment at the top, then slowly lower the kettlebells back to shoulder level.
5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Clean the kettlebells to the rack position with the bells resting on the backs of your forearms before pressing.
- Press straight overhead by driving the kettlebells up and slightly inward so they meet over your head at lockout.
- Keep your core braced and avoid arching your lower back, especially on the last few reps when fatigue sets in.

## Common mistakes

- Pressing the kettlebells forward in front of the face instead of directly overhead, which loads the front delts and stresses the shoulders.
- Leaning back excessively to use chest and momentum instead of strict shoulder pressing.
- Not stabilizing the wrist, allowing the kettlebell to flop backward and strain the wrist joint.
