## How to perform

1. Adjust the cable machine so that the preacher curl pad is at chest height.
2. Sit on the preacher curl bench and place your upper arms on the pad, gripping the cable attachment with an underhand grip.
3. Keep your back straight and your elbows tucked in at your sides.
4. Slowly curl the cable attachment up towards your shoulders, squeezing your biceps at the top of the movement.
5. Pause for a moment, then slowly lower the cable attachment back down to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Press the back of your upper arms firmly into the preacher pad throughout the entire rep. If your arms lift off, the weight is too heavy.
- Lower the cable slowly for a full 2-3 second eccentric to take advantage of the stretch position, where the bicep is most vulnerable to growth.
- Stop just short of full elbow lockout at the bottom to keep tension on the biceps and protect the elbow joint.

## Common mistakes

- Lifting the elbows off the preacher pad at the top of the curl, which brings the front delts into the movement.
- Fully extending the elbows at the bottom, which places excessive stress on the bicep tendon and elbow joint.
- Leaning back to curl the weight up instead of keeping the torso pressed against the pad.
