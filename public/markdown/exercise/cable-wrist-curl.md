## How to perform

1. Attach a straight bar to a low pulley cable machine.
2. Stand facing the machine with your feet shoulder-width apart.
3. Grasp the bar with an underhand grip, palms facing up, and your hands shoulder-width apart.
4. Rest your forearms on a bench or pad, with your wrists hanging off the edge.
5. Keeping your forearms stationary, exhale and curl your wrists upward as far as possible.
6. Pause for a moment at the top, then inhale and slowly lower the bar back to the starting position.
7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Rest your forearms on a bench with your palms facing up and wrists hanging off the edge. Curl your wrists upward, squeezing the forearm flexors at the top.
- Let the bar roll down to your fingertips at the bottom for extra range of motion, then curl your fingers closed before curling the wrist up.
- Use moderate weight and higher reps (12-20) since the forearm flexors are endurance-oriented muscles.

## Common mistakes

- Lifting the forearms off the bench during the curl, which recruits the biceps and reduces forearm isolation.
- Using too heavy a weight with a tiny range of motion. Full wrist extension to full wrist flexion is the goal.
- Performing reps too quickly without a squeeze at the top, which reduces the effectiveness of each rep.
