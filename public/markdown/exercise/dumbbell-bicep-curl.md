## How to perform

1. Stand up straight with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing forward and arms fully extended.
2. Keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps.
3. Continue to raise the weights until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level.
4. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.
5. Inhale and slowly begin to lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

## Pro tips

- Stand with dumbbells at your sides, palms forward, and curl both simultaneously. Keep your elbows pinned to your sides throughout.
- Squeeze your biceps hard at the top and lower for a full 2-3 seconds to maximize the eccentric contraction.
- Do not swing the dumbbells. If you need momentum, the weight is too heavy. Choose a load where you can control every inch of the rep.

## Common mistakes

- Swinging the torso backward to curl the weight, which uses momentum and can strain the lower back.
- Letting the elbows drift forward at the top, which uses the front delts to hold the weight and reduces bicep tension.
- Dropping the weight quickly on the way down instead of controlling the eccentric.
