You see them everywhere. Instagram fitness influencers with shoulders like bowling balls. YouTubers who claim to be natural while looking like comic book characters. That transformation photo with "just creatine and chicken breast" in the caption. That guy at your gym who went from average to massive in six months.

The message is clear: if you want serious results, you need steroids.

That message is completely wrong. Believing it might be one of the most expensive mistakes you'll ever make.

## What anabolic steroids actually are

Anabolic steroids are synthetic versions of testosterone. They flood your body with far more hormone than it naturally produces, often reaching testosterone levels of 2,000-5,000 ng/dL compared to a natural range of 300-900 ng/dL. This forces your muscles to grow faster and your body to recover quicker.

When you take steroids, you're not just adding muscle-building capacity. You're overriding your body's hormone system. You're asking your heart, liver, kidneys, and brain to function in an environment they weren't designed for. Your liver doesn't care about your beach body goals. Some people get lucky. Most don't.

## Steroid side effects: the real health risks

A [study published in the Journal of Internal Medicine](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/joim.12850) followed steroid users for over seven years. Steroid users had **three times the risk of death** compared to non-users (hazard ratio 3.0, 95% CI 1.3-7.0). A [2024 study in JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2816584) found even higher risks, with a 3.64-fold increase in unnatural deaths and 2.24-fold increase in natural deaths.

Three times. Not a small increase. Three times more likely to die during the study period.

What kills steroid users?

### Cardiovascular damage

This is the most common serious complication. Steroids increase LDL cholesterol (the bad kind), decrease HDL cholesterol (the protective kind), and cause structural changes to heart muscle. Left ventricular hypertrophy, where your heart muscle thickens in ways that impair function, is well-documented in steroid users. Heart attacks in users under 30 appear regularly in medical literature.

Natural training [improves cardiovascular health during recovery periods](/blog/muscle-growth-during-recovery). Steroids destroy it.

### Liver damage

Liver complications range from elevated enzyme levels to tumors. Oral steroids are particularly harsh because they pass through the liver repeatedly. According to the [NCBI Bookshelf on Androgenic Steroids](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK548931/), some users develop peliosis hepatis, a condition where blood-filled cysts form in the liver. These can rupture and cause fatal internal bleeding.

### Psychological effects

These get dismissed as "roid rage" jokes. The research shows increased rates of depression, anxiety, and psychotic episodes. When you stop using, the hormone crash can trigger severe depression. Not feeling down for a few days. Clinical depression that requires intervention. Some users never fully recover.

### Reproductive system shutdown

Your body stops producing its own testosterone when you flood the system with synthetic versions. Come off steroids without proper protocol, and you might spend months with testosterone levels below what a healthy woman produces. Low libido is the least of your concerns. Some users never fully recover their natural production.

### Risks specific to women

Women face irreversible voice deepening, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement. These don't reverse when you stop taking steroids.

## The legal reality

In the United States, anabolic steroids are [Schedule III controlled substances](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/schedules.html) under the Controlled Substances Act. Same legal category as ketamine and certain barbiturates.

Simple possession can result in up to one year in prison and a minimum $1,000 fine for a first offense. Distribution carries up to five years and a $250,000 fine. Even buying steroids online from overseas suppliers violates federal law.

Your insurance won't cover health complications from illegal steroid use. Your employer might fire you if it comes up. Professional licenses can be revoked. This isn't hypothetical. It happens.

## Natural muscle building: what actually works

The fitness industry doesn't want you to know this: natural muscle-building potential is far higher than most people realize.

Research on untrained individuals starting proper strength training shows first-year gains of [15-25 lbs (7-11 kg) of muscle mass](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/realistic-training-goals/) are achievable for men. Women can expect roughly half that, 8-12 lbs in the first year.

Year two brings another 6-8 kg for men. Year three, another 3-4 kg. By the end of three years of focused training, most men can add 20-30 kg of muscle naturally. That's the difference between average and noticeably muscular.

The problem isn't that natural training doesn't work. Nobody sells programs with the tagline "Get great results in three years with consistent effort." They sell shortcuts that destroy your health.

This is where a good coach matters. Someone who knows what natural progress looks like, not what's possible with a syringe. [Forge](https://forgetrainer.ai) provides AI trainers who create programs based on what actually works for natural athletes, tracking your volume, intensity, and recovery to adjust your program based on how your body responds.

## How to spot steroid users (and stop comparing yourself)

The fitness industry runs on manufactured insecurity. Influencers who use steroids claim to be natural, post their physiques constantly, and sell programs or supplements that promise similar results.

You can't get those results naturally. They couldn't either. That's why they used steroids.

Signs of steroid use:

A Fat-Free Mass Index (FFMI) above 25 is the most reliable indicator. FFMI is calculated from height, weight, and body fat percentage. Natural bodybuilders, even elite ones, rarely exceed 25. Enhanced athletes commonly reach 27-30.

Year-round conditioning is another tell. Staying under 10% body fat while maintaining significant muscle mass requires either exceptional genetics or chemical assistance. Most natural bodybuilders cycle between bulking and cutting phases. Staying shredded 365 days a year isn't natural.

Rapid transformations should raise questions. Adding 15 kg of muscle in six months while losing fat isn't natural progression.

Extreme vascularity and muscle fullness at low body fat levels happens more easily with certain steroids that affect water retention and nutrient partitioning.

Capped delts and traps that look disproportionately large compared to other muscle groups occur because these muscles have high androgen receptor density. They respond particularly well to steroids.

None of this means you should accuse anyone of steroid use. It means you should stop comparing your natural progress to enhanced results. You're playing a different game.

## TRT vs. steroid abuse

Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT) gets conflated with steroid abuse. They're fundamentally different.

TRT involves bringing low testosterone levels (diagnosed through blood work, usually under 300 ng/dL) back to normal range (typically 500-900 ng/dL). It's prescribed and monitored by physicians. The goal is restoration of normal function.

Steroid abuse involves taking doses that put testosterone levels at 2,000-5,000 ng/dL or higher, often combining multiple compounds. No medical supervision. The goal is performance enhancement regardless of health impact.

Some bodybuilders call their steroid use "TRT" to make it sound legitimate. When someone claims to be on TRT while maintaining a physique that would be impossible naturally, they're abusing steroids and using medical terminology as cover.

For men with genuinely low testosterone, TRT changes everything. Steroid abuse for cosmetic purposes carries entirely different risk profiles.

## What actually works

Natural muscle building works. It's not complicated.

[Progressive overload](/blog/progressive-overload-explained) means consistently increasing the stimulus you're applying to your muscles. More weight, more reps, more sets, shorter rest periods. The specific method matters less than the consistency of progression. A program from [Forge](https://forgetrainer.ai) tracks this automatically.

Adequate protein and calories provide the building blocks for new muscle tissue. Aim for roughly 1.6-2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, coupled with a slight caloric surplus during muscle-building phases. No supplement replaces this foundation.

[Recovery and consistency](/blog/science-of-workout-consistency) beat perfection. [Training four days a week for a year](/blog/best-workout-split-guide) produces better results than training six days a week for two months before burning out. Your body builds muscle during recovery, not during workouts.

The biggest advantage steroids provide isn't faster muscle growth in the gym. It's improved recovery. Steroid users can train with higher volume and frequency because their bodies repair faster. Natural athletes need to be smarter about recovery.

That's where proper programming matters. Cookie-cutter programs don't account for your individual recovery capacity. [Working with trainers who understand natural progression](/blog/personalized-workout-plans-vs-generic) ensures you're training at the right intensity and volume for your body. [Forge](https://forgetrainer.ai) adapts to how you're recovering, adjusting volume based on your feedback, performance, and [progress tracking](/blog/how-to-track-fitness-progress).

## The bottom line

Millions of Americans use anabolic steroids recreationally, though exact numbers are difficult to verify since most drug use surveys don't include questions about steroids. Most start because they don't believe natural training will get them where they want to go.

They're wrong. Natural training with proper programming, nutrition, and consistency produces impressive results. Results that last. Results that don't come with cardiovascular damage, liver problems, or hormonal shutdown.

The fitness industry profits from your impatience. It shows you enhanced physiques, calls them natural, and sells you solutions for the gap between where you are and where those enhanced athletes are.

Close Instagram. Stop following enhanced athletes who claim to be natural. Work with coaching that understands natural progression.

You don't need steroids to build an impressive physique. You need patience, consistency, and programming designed for natural athletes.

[Forge](https://forgetrainer.ai) provides that. AI trainers who understand natural progression. Programs that adapt to your recovery capacity. Guidance based on what works for natural athletes, not what works when you're running a gram of test.

Three years from now, you'll either be significantly more muscular from consistent natural training, or you'll be dealing with the consequences of shortcuts that weren't worth taking.

Choose.
