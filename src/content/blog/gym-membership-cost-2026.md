The average gym membership in the US costs between $50 and $65 per month in 2026, depending on location and membership tier. But averages hide the real story.

Planet Fitness charges $15 for basic access. Equinox charges $200-300 or more. Both count toward that same average. Your actual cost depends on which gym you join, where you live, and which fees you catch in the fine print.

Most gyms advertise one monthly rate, then charge initiation fees, annual maintenance fees, processing fees, and cancellation penalties. A "$40/month" membership typically costs $100-200 more in year one after accounting for these extras.

This guide breaks down exactly what gym memberships cost at 20+ chains across budget, mid-range, and premium tiers, plus the hidden fees most people miss.

## Gym membership cost by tier: quick comparison

**Budget gyms ($15-50/month):**
- Planet Fitness: $15 basic, $25-30 Black Card
- Crunch Fitness: $10-30 depending on tier
- Anytime Fitness: $35-60

**Mid-range gyms ($30-80/month):**
- LA Fitness: $30-50
- 24 Hour Fitness: $40-65
- Gold's Gym: $30-60
- YMCA: $30-70 (sliding scale available)

**Premium gyms ($150-300+/month):**
- Equinox: $200-300+
- Lifetime Fitness: $72-250

**Specialty/Boutique:**
- CrossFit: $150-250
- Orangetheory: $59-199
- Barry's Bootcamp: $38/class or unlimited packages

All prices are monthly rates before hidden fees, which we cover below.

## Budget tier gyms: $15-50/month

Basic equipment and facilities at low prices. You get cardio machines, resistance equipment, and essential amenities.

### Planet Fitness: $15-30/month

The lowest advertised rate in the industry. Two membership levels:

**Basic membership: $15/month**
- Access to your home club only
- Standard cardio and strength equipment
- No guest privileges
- No tanning or massage chairs

**Black Card membership: $25-30/month**
- Access to all [Planet Fitness](https://www.planetfitness.com/gym-memberships/) locations nationwide
- Guest privileges (bring a friend free)
- Tanning and massage chairs
- Half-price cooler drinks

**Hidden fees:**
- Annual fee: $49 (charged once per year)
- Initiation fee: $1-39 (often $1 during promotions)

True first-year cost: $230-268 for Basic, $350-388 for Black Card.

Planet Fitness markets itself as a "judgment-free zone" for beginners and casual exercisers. You'll find cardio machines and resistance equipment, but many locations don't have barbells, squat racks, or deadlift platforms. They discourage heavy lifting or grunting with a "lunk alarm."

Good for cardio, machine-based training, and [people who are new to the gym](https://forgetrainer.ai/blog/first-time-at-gym-trainers-guide). Not ideal if you want to progress to serious strength training.

### Crunch Fitness: $10-30/month

Crunch offers more amenities than Planet Fitness at comparable prices.

**Base membership: $10-15/month**
- Home club access only
- Basic cardio and weights
- Group fitness classes

**Peak membership: $25-30/month**
- Access to all [Crunch](https://www.crunch.com/join) locations
- Guest privileges
- Premium group classes
- Tanning and HydroMassage (location-dependent)

**Hidden fees:**
- Annual fee: Up to $89 (varies by location)
- Initiation fee: $0-50

True first-year cost: $209-499 depending on tier and location.

Crunch falls between Planet Fitness and mid-tier gyms. Better equipment selection, including squat racks and free weights at most locations. Stronger group fitness class variety than Planet Fitness. Expect crowds during peak hours.

### Anytime Fitness: $35-60/month

Franchise model means pricing varies significantly by location and owner.

**Standard membership:**
- 24/7 access to your home club
- Access to all [Anytime Fitness](https://www.anytimefitness.com/membership) locations worldwide after 30 days
- Small studio format (8,000-10,000 sq ft typical)
- Basic strength and cardio equipment

**Hidden fees:**
- Initiation fee: $0-99 (varies by franchise)
- Annual fee: $49-59 (varies by franchise)
- Key fob fee: $20-50 one-time

True first-year cost: $489-879 depending on franchise.

The advantage is 24/7 access and worldwide reciprocity. Works well for shift workers, travelers, and people with irregular schedules. Small footprint means limited equipment, though.

Quality varies dramatically by franchise owner. Visit your specific location before committing.

## Mid-range tier gyms: $30-80/month

More space, better equipment, amenities like pools and classes, and broader facilities than budget gyms.

### LA Fitness: $30-50/month

One of the largest chains in the US with 700+ locations.

**Single club access: $30-40/month**
- One location only
- Full gym access including pool, basketball courts, group classes

**Multi-club access: $40-50/month**
- Access to all [LA Fitness](https://www.lafitness.com/) locations

**Hidden fees:**
- Initiation fee: $0-99 (often negotiable during promotions)
- Annual fee: $59

True first-year cost: $419-758 depending on tier and negotiation.

LA Fitness facilities are large (25,000-50,000 sq ft) with comprehensive equipment. Pools, basketball courts, racquetball, steam rooms, and saunas at most locations. Group fitness classes included.

Equipment quality varies by location age. Expect significant crowding during 5-7 PM weekdays.

### 24 Hour Fitness: $40-65/month

Similar market position to LA Fitness with regional concentration in the western US.

**Monthly pricing tiers:**
- Silver: $20-30/month (month-to-month)
- Gold: $25-52/month (month-to-month)
- Platinum: $40-70/month (month-to-month)

12-month commitments reduce monthly costs by $5-15.

**Hidden fees:**
- Initiation fee: $50-100
- Annual fee: $60

True first-year cost: $590-930 depending on tier.

[24 Hour Fitness](https://www.24hourfitness.com/membership/membership-options/) went through bankruptcy restructuring in 2020 and closed 100+ clubs. Remaining locations have seen renovation investment.

Not all locations operate 24 hours anymore. Some run reduced hours. Verify your location's specific schedule before joining.

### Gold's Gym: $30-60/month

Franchise model with pricing variability by location.

**Standard membership: $30-60/month**
- Pricing varies significantly by franchise and market
- Most locations include pools, classes, extensive free weight areas
- Brand heritage in bodybuilding culture

**Hidden fees:**
- Initiation fee: $0-100 (varies by promotion)
- Annual fee: $40-50

True first-year cost: $400-820.

[Gold's Gym](https://www.goldsgym.com/) has stronger bodybuilding culture than most chains. Better free weight areas, more squat racks and bench press stations, fewer restrictions on intense training.

Quality varies by franchise owner. Research your specific location before joining.

### YMCA: $30-70/month (adults)

Non-profit community organization with fitness facilities.

**Adult membership: $30-70/month**
- Varies by local chapter
- Pool access at most locations
- Group fitness classes
- Basketball courts, indoor tracks (location-dependent)

**Family memberships: $80-140/month**
- Two adults plus children
- Youth sports and activities
- Childcare during workouts (at participating locations)

**Notable differences:**
- No initiation fees at most locations
- Sliding scale pricing for low-income members
- Month-to-month with easier cancellation than commercial gyms

True first-year cost: $360-840 (no initiation or annual fees at most branches).

[YMCAs](https://www.ymca.org/) serve community fitness needs rather than maximizing profit. Equipment is functional but not luxurious. Strong programming for families, seniors, and youth.

If the standard rate exceeds your budget, ask about sliding scale pricing based on income verification.

## Premium tier gyms: $150-300+/month

Premium gyms sell experience as much as equipment. Luxury locker rooms, high-end amenities, and exclusivity justify higher prices.

### Equinox: $200-300+/month

The luxury standard in major metros.

**Standard membership: $200-285/month** (varies by market and tier)
- Single Club Access: $198-250/month
- All-Access: $260-285/month
- Premium group fitness classes
- High-end locker room products

**Hidden fees:**
- Initiation fee: $100-500
- Monthly processing fee: $0-15 (location-dependent)

True first-year cost: $2,498-3,920 depending on tier and market.

[Equinox](https://www.equinox.com/join/step1) focuses on aesthetics and experience. Clean facilities, top-tier equipment, luxury locker rooms, and classes (cycling, precision running, yoga) taught by career instructors.

Whether that justifies 4-6 times the cost of a mid-tier gym depends on how much you value environment. The equipment doesn't deliver better results. The atmosphere might make you more likely to show up consistently.

### Lifetime Fitness: $72-250/month

Massive facilities (100,000+ sq ft) with resort-like amenities.

**Membership tiers:**
- Individual: $72-219/month
- Couple: $122-369/month
- Family: $142-499/month
- Signature tier: $179-329/month (includes studio classes)

Pricing varies significantly by location and tier.

**Amenities include:**
- Pools, waterslides, spa facilities
- Extensive childcare
- Basketball courts, rock climbing, Pilates reformer studios

**Hidden fees:**
- Initiation fee: $0-400 (varies by promotion)

True first-year cost: $864-3,388 depending on tier and location.

[Lifetime](https://www.lifetime.life/) positions as a family fitness destination. Parents can work out while kids participate in supervised activities. Less urban/trendy than Equinox, more suburban family-oriented.

If you have kids and want somewhere everyone in the family can spend time, Lifetime makes sense. For solo training, you're paying for amenities you won't use.

## Specialty and boutique gyms

These focus on specific training methodologies rather than general fitness.

### CrossFit: $150-250/month

CrossFit boxes charge more than commercial gyms because classes are coached and capped at 10-20 people.

**Unlimited membership: $150-250/month**
- Unlimited class attendance
- Coached sessions (not open gym)
- Programming included

**Limited membership: $100-150/month**
- 2-3 classes per week

**Drop-ins: $20-30 per class**

No hidden fees typically. Month-to-month memberships are common. Some boxes charge $100-200 for introductory courses.

You're paying for coached classes, community, and programming. Quality varies dramatically by box owner and coaching staff. Visit and try a class before committing.

### Orangetheory Fitness: $59-199/month

Heart rate-based interval training in coached group classes.

**Membership tiers:**
- Basic (4 classes/month): $59-79
- Elite (8 classes/month): $99-159
- Premier (unlimited classes): $149-199

Exceed your tier limit and additional classes cost $28-32 each.

**Additional costs:**
- Heart rate monitor purchase (required): $80-110 one-time

True first-year cost: $788-2,498 depending on tier.

[Orangetheory](https://www.orangetheory.com/en-us/memberships) provides structured, coached workouts with heart rate tracking and performance data. Works well for people who thrive in group environments and want programming handled for them.

### Barry's Bootcamp: $38/class or packages

Boutique HIIT training in major cities.

**Pricing (varies by location):**
- Single class: $38 (NYC pricing)
- 5 classes: $185
- 10 classes: $330-350

Unlimited monthly memberships available at select locations. No hidden fees. No initiation costs.

[Barry's](https://www.barrys.com/pricing) delivers intense workouts, half treadmill intervals, half floor strength work. For the price of unlimited Barry's, you could join a mid-tier gym and hire a personal trainer twice monthly. You're paying for brand, experience, and community.

## Hidden fees that add $100-200+ to advertised rates

Every gym advertises monthly cost. Most bury additional fees in contracts.

### Initiation/enrollment fees: $0-500

One-time charge when you first join. Also called "startup fees" or "enrollment fees."

- Budget gyms: $1-50
- Mid-tier gyms: $50-100
- Premium gyms: $100-500

**These are often negotiable.** Walk in at the end of the month when salespeople need to hit quotas and ask directly if they can waive the fee. Success rate is high, especially during promotional periods.

### Annual maintenance fees: $40-89

Charged once per year on top of monthly dues. Non-negotiable at most chains.

Planet Fitness charges $49. LA Fitness charges $59. 24 Hour Fitness charges $60. Crunch charges up to $89 depending on location.

Gyms claim this covers facility maintenance and equipment replacement. In practice, it pads profit margins.

### Processing fees: $0-15/month

Some gyms charge monthly fees just to process your payment.

Add this to monthly dues when calculating total cost. A "$200/month" membership with a $15 processing fee actually costs $215/month, or $2,580 annually.

### Freeze fees: $5-15/month

Want to pause your membership while traveling or recovering from injury? Most gyms allow "freezing" but charge monthly fees while frozen.

Typical freeze fee: $5-15/month for up to 3 months. You're paying for a membership you can't use, just less than the full rate.

### Cancellation penalties and requirements

Leaving a gym membership is harder than joining.

**Early termination fees:** Many gyms require 12-month commitments. Cancel early, and you pay $100-200 or the remaining balance on your contract.

**Notice requirements:** Month-to-month memberships still require 30-60 days written notice to cancel. Stop paying without notice, and they'll send your account to collections.

**Cancellation process:** Many gyms require in-person cancellation, certified mail, or specific forms. They make it deliberately difficult to quit.

### Other common fees

- Guest fees: $10-20 per visit (unless your tier includes guest privileges)
- Towel service: $5-15/month at mid-range and premium gyms
- Locker rental: $5-15/month for a permanent locker
- Class reservations: $5-10 to reserve spots in popular classes at some gyms

## Regional cost variation

The national average means little depending on where you live.

**Most expensive markets (40-60% above average):** New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, Washington DC. Equinox in Manhattan costs $250-300/month. Equinox in Dallas costs $180-220. Same brand, 30-40% price difference.

**Mid-cost markets (10-30% above average):** Seattle, Chicago, Denver, Austin, Miami.

**Below-average markets:** Phoenix, Dallas, Atlanta, Kansas City, and most mid-size cities.

**Lowest-cost markets (20-40% below average):** Rural areas, small cities throughout the Midwest and South.

Planet Fitness charges the same $15 base rate everywhere (corporate pricing consistency). Mid-tier and franchise gyms show the biggest regional variation.

## Cost per workout: what you're actually paying

Monthly cost tells you little. Cost per workout reveals the real value.

At 4 workouts per week (16 visits per month):

- Planet Fitness ($15/month): **$0.94 per visit**
- Crunch Fitness ($25/month): **$1.56 per visit**
- LA Fitness ($45/month): **$2.81 per visit**
- 24 Hour Fitness ($55/month): **$3.44 per visit**
- Equinox ($215/month with processing fee): **$13.44 per visit**
- Lifetime Fitness ($200/month): **$12.50 per visit**
- CrossFit ($200/month unlimited): **$12.50 per visit**

Now consider how often you actually go.

[18% of gym memberships are completely unused, and 67% of members rarely or never use their memberships](https://www.exercise.com/grow/gym-membership-statistics/). That adds up to roughly $1.3 billion wasted annually on memberships people don't use.

If you join at $50/month intending to train 4 times per week but actually go once a week, your real cost per visit is $12.50. At that rate, you'd pay less per workout at boutique fitness studios.

A gym you use 5 times per week at $200/month costs $10 per workout. A gym you use once per week at $20/month costs $5 per workout but delivers far worse results. Frequency matters more than monthly price.

## What drives gym membership adherence

Gym membership price doesn't determine how often you'll work out. Research on fitness adherence identifies four key factors:

**Proximity:** Gyms within 10 minutes of home or work see 4-6 times higher adherence than gyms 20+ minutes away.

**Enjoyment:** People return to gyms where they enjoy the experience. Cleanliness, equipment quality, and atmosphere matter more than price.

**Social factors:** Training with friends or participating in group classes increases consistency. Group fitness classes can [reduce membership cancellations by 56%](https://www.exercise.com/grow/gym-membership-statistics/).

**Programming clarity:** People who know what to do when they arrive train more consistently than people who wander between machines.

## Employer gym membership subsidies

[87% of Fortune 500 companies offer wellness programs, and 68% specifically subsidize gym memberships](https://www.healthfitnessrevolution.com/fortune-100-fitness-wellness-programs/).

[Active&Fit Direct](https://www.activeandfitdirect.com/) is the largest corporate wellness program. Participating employers offer employees access to 12,800+ gyms for $28/month with no initiation fees. This includes Planet Fitness, Crunch, YMCA, Anytime Fitness, and other chains that normally cost $40-70/month.

Check with your HR department. Many employees don't realize they have this benefit.

Some employers reimburse gym memberships partially (50% reimbursement is common) or fully. If your employer offers subsidized gym access and you're not using it, you're leaving money on the table.

## When negotiating works

Gym pricing is more flexible than most people realize.

**Best times to negotiate:**
- February (post-New Year rush, salespeople need to hit quotas)
- September (slow period between summer and fall)
- Last 3-5 days of any month (monthly sales targets)

**What you can negotiate:**
- Initiation fees (easiest, high success rate if you simply ask)
- Month-to-month vs. annual contract
- Perks like guest privileges or towel service

**What you can't negotiate:**
- Monthly base rate at corporate chains
- Annual fees (system-wide, almost never waived)

**How to do it:**
1. Visit in person during negotiation-friendly times
2. Mention competitive gyms and their pricing
3. Ask directly: "Can you waive the initiation fee?"
4. Be willing to walk away

The worst outcome is they say no. Best case, you save $50-100.

## Gym membership vs. home gym vs. AI trainer

Gym memberships aren't your only option.

**Home gym:** $500-2,000 upfront for basic setup (barbell, plates, rack, bench). No monthly cost after that. Saves commute time. Limited equipment variety. Our guide to [home workouts vs. gym](https://forgetrainer.ai/blog/home-workouts-vs-gym) compares these approaches.

**AI personal trainer apps:** $10-30/month for personalized programming. [Forge](https://forgetrainer.ai) provides custom workout plans adapted to your goals, equipment access, and schedule. Works with any gym, home gym, or hotel gym. Compare options in our [best AI personal trainer apps guide](https://forgetrainer.ai/blog/best-ai-personal-trainer-apps-2026).

**Traditional personal training:** $300-800/month for twice-weekly sessions, covered in our [personal trainer cost guide](https://forgetrainer.ai/blog/how-much-does-personal-trainer-cost). Expensive but effective for people who need hands-on guidance.

For people on tight budgets, combining a budget gym membership ($15/month Planet Fitness) with an AI trainer ($20/month [Forge](https://forgetrainer.ai)) delivers personalized programming with equipment access for $35/month total. That's less than most mid-tier gym memberships alone, with better programming than most people create themselves. For more strategies, check out our guide to [personal training on a budget](https://forgetrainer.ai/blog/personal-training-on-a-budget).

## The bottom line on gym membership costs

**Average gym membership in 2026:** $50-65/month before hidden fees.

**True first-year cost ranges:**
- Budget gyms: $230-600
- Mid-tier gyms: $400-930
- Premium gyms: $864-3,920
- Specialty gyms: $788-3,000+

**Hidden fees add $100-200+** to advertised rates through initiation fees, annual fees, processing fees, and cancellation penalties.

**Location matters.** Major metros cost 40-60% more than suburban or rural areas for the same gym brands.

**Cost per visit matters more than monthly cost.** A gym you use 4 times per week at $50/month ($3.12/visit) delivers better value than a gym you use once per week at $20/month ($5/visit).

**18% of memberships are completely unused.** 67% of members rarely or never use theirs. Don't pay for something you're not using.

**Negotiate initiation fees** at the end of the month when salespeople need to hit quotas.

**Check for employer subsidies.** 87% of Fortune 500 companies offer wellness programs, and 68% subsidize gym memberships through programs like Active&Fit Direct ($28/month for 12,800+ gyms).

Join the gym closest to your home or office, with hours that match your schedule, at a price you can sustain long-term. Proximity, convenience, and affordability predict adherence better than amenities or brand name.

## Frequently asked questions

### How much is the average gym membership per month?

$50-65 per month across all gym types in the US in 2026. Budget gyms cost $15-50/month. Mid-tier gyms cost $30-80/month. Premium gyms cost $150-300+/month. Hidden fees (initiation, annual, processing) add $100-200+ to first-year costs.

### What are the cheapest gyms in 2026?

Planet Fitness ($15/month basic, $25-30 Black Card), Crunch Fitness ($10-30/month depending on tier), and Anytime Fitness ($35-60/month) are the lowest-cost national chains. True first-year cost for budget gyms: $230-600.

### Are expensive gyms worth the extra cost?

Not for fitness results alone. No research shows that premium gyms deliver better workout outcomes than budget gyms. You're paying for amenities (luxury locker rooms, pools, spa services), atmosphere, and exclusivity. Premium gyms make sense if you value experience and can easily afford the cost. For people focused purely on results, mid-tier or budget gyms work just as well.

### Can you negotiate gym membership prices?

Yes, especially initiation fees. Visit at the end of the month when salespeople need to hit quotas. Ask directly if they can waive the fee. Monthly base rates are harder to negotiate at corporate chains. Annual fees are almost never waived.

### What hidden fees do gyms charge?

Initiation fees ($0-500 one-time), annual maintenance fees ($40-89 once per year), processing fees ($0-15/month at some gyms), freeze fees ($5-15/month to pause membership), early cancellation fees ($100-200 if you quit before contract ends), guest fees ($10-20 per visit), and towel service ($5-15/month). These add $100-200+ to first-year costs.

### Is a gym membership worth it if I can work out at home?

Depends on your situation. Gyms provide equipment variety, dedicated workout space, and social environment that increases adherence for some people. Home workouts cost less ($0 for bodyweight, $500-2,000 for a basic home gym). AI trainers like [Forge](https://forgetrainer.ai) ($20/month) work for both home and gym training, providing professional programming without the gym membership cost. See our [home workouts vs. gym comparison](https://forgetrainer.ai/blog/home-workouts-vs-gym) for more detail.

### How do I cancel a gym membership without fees?

Read your contract for notice requirements (typically 30-60 days written notice). Cancel before the end of your contract term, or wait until it ends. Some gyms require in-person cancellation or certified mail. Never just stop paying without officially canceling, or they'll send your account to collections. Month-to-month memberships are easier to cancel but still require proper notice.

### Do college students get gym membership discounts?

Many gyms offer student discounts (10-20% off), but policies vary by chain and location. College campuses usually provide free gym facilities included in student fees. Off-campus gyms sometimes offer student rates with valid ID. YMCA offers student pricing at some locations.
