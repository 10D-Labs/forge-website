## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is Forge and how does it work?

Forge is an AI-powered personal fitness trainer app. You tell it your goals, fitness level, available equipment, and schedule, and it creates a custom workout plan designed specifically for you. You can chat with your AI trainer 24/7 for guidance on workouts, exercises, or fitness questions, and it tracks your progress over time to keep you on course.

### How is Forge different from other fitness apps?

Most fitness apps offer generic, one-size-fits-all workout plans. Forge provides truly personalized programming that adapts to your individual response, plus multiple AI trainers you can choose from based on what motivates you. Whether you want tough love, gentle encouragement, a casual gym buddy, or a data-driven coach, Forge matches your training style.
